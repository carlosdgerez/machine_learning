              "'Chapter I. Into the Primitive\\r\\n\\r\\n“Old longings nomadic leap,\\r\\nChafing at custom’s chain;\\r\\nAgain from its brumal sleep\\r\\nWakens the ferine strain.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble\\r\\nwas brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog,\\r\\nstrong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San\\r\\nDiego. Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow\\r\\nmetal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming\\r\\nthe find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men\\r\\nwanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong\\r\\nmuscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the\\r\\nfrost.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge\\r\\nMiller’s place, it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden\\r\\namong the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide\\r\\ncool veranda that ran around its four sides. The house was approached\\r\\nby gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns\\r\\nand under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things\\r\\nwere on even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great\\r\\nstables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad\\r\\nservants’ cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long\\r\\ngrape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. Then there\\r\\nwas the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank\\r\\nwhere Judge Miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in\\r\\nthe hot afternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd over this great demesne Buck ruled. Here he was born, and here he\\r\\nhad lived the four years of his life. It was true, there were other\\r\\ndogs, There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place, but they\\r\\ndid not count. They came and went, resided in the populous kennels, or\\r\\nlived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of\\r\\nToots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless,—strange\\r\\ncreatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On\\r\\nthe other hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least,\\r\\nwho yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the\\r\\nwindows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with\\r\\nbrooms and mops.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his.\\r\\nHe plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge’s\\r\\nsons; he escorted Mollie and Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on long\\r\\ntwilight or early morning rambles; on wintry nights he lay at the\\r\\nJudge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the Judge’s\\r\\ngrandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their\\r\\nfootsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable\\r\\nyard, and even beyond, where the paddocks were, and the berry patches.\\r\\nAmong the terriers he stalked imperiously, and Toots and Ysabel he\\r\\nutterly ignored, for he was king,—king over all creeping, crawling,\\r\\nflying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis father, Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, had been the Judge’s inseparable\\r\\ncompanion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. He was\\r\\nnot so large,—he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds,—for his\\r\\nmother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred\\r\\nand forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good\\r\\nliving and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right\\r\\nroyal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived\\r\\nthe life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was\\r\\neven a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become\\r\\nbecause of their insular situation. But he had saved himself by not\\r\\nbecoming a mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor\\r\\ndelights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as\\r\\nto the cold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a\\r\\nhealth preserver.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this was the manner of dog Buck was in the fall of 1897, when the\\r\\nKlondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen North.\\r\\nBut Buck did not read the newspapers, and he did not know that Manuel,\\r\\none of the gardener’s helpers, was an undesirable acquaintance. Manuel\\r\\nhad one besetting sin. He loved to play Chinese lottery. Also, in his\\r\\ngambling, he had one besetting weakness—faith in a system; and this\\r\\nmade his damnation certain. For to play a system requires money, while\\r\\nthe wages of a gardener’s helper do not lap over the needs of a wife\\r\\nand numerous progeny.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Judge was at a meeting of the Raisin Growers’ Association, and the\\r\\nboys were busy organizing an athletic club, on the memorable night of\\r\\nManuel’s treachery. No one saw him and Buck go off through the orchard\\r\\non what Buck imagined was merely a stroll. And with the exception of a\\r\\nsolitary man, no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known\\r\\nas College Park. This man talked with Manuel, and money chinked between\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You might wrap up the goods before you deliver ’m,” the stranger said\\r\\ngruffly, and Manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around Buck’s neck\\r\\nunder the collar.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Twist it, an’ you’ll choke ’m plentee,” said Manuel, and the stranger\\r\\ngrunted a ready affirmative.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity. To be sure, it was an\\r\\nunwonted performance: but he had learned to trust in men he knew, and\\r\\nto give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own. But when the\\r\\nends of the rope were placed in the stranger’s hands, he growled\\r\\nmenacingly. He had merely intimated his displeasure, in his pride\\r\\nbelieving that to intimate was to command. But to his surprise the rope\\r\\ntightened around his neck, shutting off his breath. In quick rage he\\r\\nsprang at the man, who met him halfway, grappled him close by the\\r\\nthroat, and with a deft twist threw him over on his back. Then the rope\\r\\ntightened mercilessly, while Buck struggled in a fury, his tongue\\r\\nlolling out of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely. Never in\\r\\nall his life had he been so vilely treated, and never in all his life\\r\\nhad he been so angry. But his strength ebbed, his eyes glazed, and he\\r\\nknew nothing when the train was flagged and the two men threw him into\\r\\nthe baggage car.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next he knew, he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and\\r\\nthat he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance. The hoarse\\r\\nshriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was. He\\r\\nhad travelled too often with the Judge not to know the sensation of\\r\\nriding in a baggage car. He opened his eyes, and into them came the\\r\\nunbridled anger of a kidnapped king. The man sprang for his throat, but\\r\\nBuck was too quick for him. His jaws closed on the hand, nor did they\\r\\nrelax till his senses were choked out of him once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yep, has fits,” the man said, hiding his mangled hand from the\\r\\nbaggageman, who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle. “I’m\\r\\ntakin’ ’m up for the boss to ’Frisco. A crack dog-doctor there thinks\\r\\nthat he can cure ’m.”\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerning that night’s ride, the man spoke most eloquently for\\r\\nhimself, in a little shed back of a saloon on the San Francisco water\\r\\nfront.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All I get is fifty for it,” he grumbled; “an’ I wouldn’t do it over\\r\\nfor a thousand, cold cash.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief, and the right trouser\\r\\nleg was ripped from knee to ankle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How much did the other mug get?” the saloon-keeper demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A hundred,” was the reply. “Wouldn’t take a sou less, so help me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That makes a hundred and fifty,” the saloon-keeper calculated; “and\\r\\nhe’s worth it, or I’m a squarehead.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe kidnapper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated\\r\\nhand. “If I don’t get the hydrophoby—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’ll be because you was born to hang,” laughed the saloon-keeper.\\r\\n“Here, lend me a hand before you pull your freight,” he added.\\r\\n\\r\\nDazed, suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue, with the life\\r\\nhalf throttled out of him, Buck attempted to face his tormentors. But\\r\\nhe was thrown down and choked repeatedly, till they succeeded in filing\\r\\nthe heavy brass collar from off his neck. Then the rope was removed,\\r\\nand he was flung into a cagelike crate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere he lay for the remainder of the weary night, nursing his wrath\\r\\nand wounded pride. He could not understand what it all meant. What did\\r\\nthey want with him, these strange men? Why were they keeping him pent\\r\\nup in this narrow crate? He did not know why, but he felt oppressed by\\r\\nthe vague sense of impending calamity. Several times during the night\\r\\nhe sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open, expecting to see\\r\\nthe Judge, or the boys at least. But each time it was the bulging face\\r\\nof the saloon-keeper that peered in at him by the sickly light of a\\r\\ntallow candle. And each time the joyful bark that trembled in Buck’s\\r\\nthroat was twisted into a savage growl.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the saloon-keeper let him alone, and in the morning four men\\r\\nentered and picked up the crate. More tormentors, Buck decided, for\\r\\nthey were evil-looking creatures, ragged and unkempt; and he stormed\\r\\nand raged at them through the bars. They only laughed and poked sticks\\r\\nat him, which he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that\\r\\nthat was what they wanted. Whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed\\r\\nthe crate to be lifted into a wagon. Then he, and the crate in which he\\r\\nwas imprisoned, began a passage through many hands. Clerks in the\\r\\nexpress office took charge of him; he was carted about in another\\r\\nwagon; a truck carried him, with an assortment of boxes and parcels,\\r\\nupon a ferry steamer; he was trucked off the steamer into a great\\r\\nrailway depot, and finally he was deposited in an express car.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail\\r\\nof shrieking locomotives; and for two days and nights Buck neither ate\\r\\nnor drank. In his anger he had met the first advances of the express\\r\\nmessengers with growls, and they had retaliated by teasing him. When he\\r\\nflung himself against the bars, quivering and frothing, they laughed at\\r\\nhim and taunted him. They growled and barked like detestable dogs,\\r\\nmewed, and flapped their arms and crowed. It was all very silly, he\\r\\nknew; but therefore the more outrage to his dignity, and his anger\\r\\nwaxed and waxed. He did not mind the hunger so much, but the lack of\\r\\nwater caused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to fever-pitch.\\r\\nFor that matter, high-strung and finely sensitive, the ill treatment\\r\\nhad flung him into a fever, which was fed by the inflammation of his\\r\\nparched and swollen throat and tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was glad for one thing: the rope was off his neck. That had given\\r\\nthem an unfair advantage; but now that it was off, he would show them.\\r\\nThey would never get another rope around his neck. Upon that he was\\r\\nresolved. For two days and nights he neither ate nor drank, and during\\r\\nthose two days and nights of torment, he accumulated a fund of wrath\\r\\nthat boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him. His eyes turned\\r\\nblood-shot, and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend. So changed\\r\\nwas he that the Judge himself would not have recognized him; and the\\r\\nexpress messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the\\r\\ntrain at Seattle.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small,\\r\\nhigh-walled back yard. A stout man, with a red sweater that sagged\\r\\ngenerously at the neck, came out and signed the book for the driver.\\r\\nThat was the man, Buck divined, the next tormentor, and he hurled\\r\\nhimself savagely against the bars. The man smiled grimly, and brought a\\r\\nhatchet and a club.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You ain’t going to take him out now?” the driver asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sure,” the man replied, driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried\\r\\nit in, and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the\\r\\nperformance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck rushed at the splintering wood, sinking his teeth into it, surging\\r\\nand wrestling with it. Wherever the hatchet fell on the outside, he was\\r\\nthere on the inside, snarling and growling, as furiously anxious to get\\r\\nout as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, you red-eyed devil,” he said, when he had made an opening\\r\\nsufficient for the passage of Buck’s body. At the same time he dropped\\r\\nthe hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Buck was truly a red-eyed devil, as he drew himself together for\\r\\nthe spring, hair bristling, mouth foaming, a mad glitter in his\\r\\nblood-shot eyes. Straight at the man he launched his one hundred and\\r\\nforty pounds of fury, surcharged with the pent passion of two days and\\r\\nnights. In mid air, just as his jaws were about to close on the man, he\\r\\nreceived a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together\\r\\nwith an agonizing clip. He whirled over, fetching the ground on his\\r\\nback and side. He had never been struck by a club in his life, and did\\r\\nnot understand. With a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was\\r\\nagain on his feet and launched into the air. And again the shock came\\r\\nand he was brought crushingly to the ground. This time he was aware\\r\\nthat it was the club, but his madness knew no caution. A dozen times he\\r\\ncharged, and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a particularly fierce blow, he crawled to his feet, too dazed to\\r\\nrush. He staggered limply about, the blood flowing from nose and mouth\\r\\nand ears, his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver.\\r\\nThen the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on\\r\\nthe nose. All the pain he had endured was as nothing compared with the\\r\\nexquisite agony of this. With a roar that was almost lionlike in its\\r\\nferocity, he again hurled himself at the man. But the man, shifting the\\r\\nclub from right to left, coolly caught him by the under jaw, at the\\r\\nsame time wrenching downward and backward. Buck described a complete\\r\\ncircle in the air, and half of another, then crashed to the ground on\\r\\nhis head and chest.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the last time he rushed. The man struck the shrewd blow he had\\r\\npurposely withheld for so long, and Buck crumpled up and went down,\\r\\nknocked utterly senseless.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s no slouch at dog-breakin’, that’s wot I say,” one of the men on\\r\\nthe wall cried enthusiastically.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Druther break cayuses any day, and twice on Sundays,” was the reply of\\r\\nthe driver, as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck’s senses came back to him, but not his strength. He lay where he\\r\\nhad fallen, and from there he watched the man in the red sweater.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Answers to the name of Buck,’” the man soliloquized, quoting from the\\r\\nsaloon-keeper’s letter which had announced the consignment of the crate\\r\\nand contents. “Well, Buck, my boy,” he went on in a genial voice,\\r\\n“we’ve had our little ruction, and the best thing we can do is to let\\r\\nit go at that. You’ve learned your place, and I know mine. Be a good\\r\\ndog and all ’ll go well and the goose hang high. Be a bad dog, and I’ll\\r\\nwhale the stuffin’ outa you. Understand?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly\\r\\npounded, and though Buck’s hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the\\r\\nhand, he endured it without protest. When the man brought him water he\\r\\ndrank eagerly, and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat, chunk by\\r\\nchunk, from the man’s hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was beaten (he knew that); but he was not broken. He saw, once for\\r\\nall, that he stood no chance against a man with a club. He had learned\\r\\nthe lesson, and in all his after life he never forgot it. That club was\\r\\na revelation. It was his introduction to the reign of primitive law,\\r\\nand he met the introduction halfway. The facts of life took on a\\r\\nfiercer aspect; and while he faced that aspect uncowed, he faced it\\r\\nwith all the latent cunning of his nature aroused. As the days went by,\\r\\nother dogs came, in crates and at the ends of ropes, some docilely, and\\r\\nsome raging and roaring as he had come; and, one and all, he watched\\r\\nthem pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater. Again and\\r\\nagain, as he looked at each brutal performance, the lesson was driven\\r\\nhome to Buck: a man with a club was a lawgiver, a master to be obeyed,\\r\\nthough not necessarily conciliated. Of this last Buck was never guilty,\\r\\nthough he did see beaten dogs that fawned upon the man, and wagged\\r\\ntheir tails, and licked his hand. Also he saw one dog, that would\\r\\nneither conciliate nor obey, finally killed in the struggle for\\r\\nmastery.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow and again men came, strangers, who talked excitedly, wheedlingly,\\r\\nand in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater. And at such\\r\\ntimes that money passed between them the strangers took one or more of\\r\\nthe dogs away with them. Buck wondered where they went, for they never\\r\\ncame back; but the fear of the future was strong upon him, and he was\\r\\nglad each time when he was not selected.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet his time came, in the end, in the form of a little weazened man who\\r\\nspat broken English and many strange and uncouth exclamations which\\r\\nBuck could not understand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sacredam!” he cried, when his eyes lit upon Buck. “Dat one dam bully\\r\\ndog! Eh? How moch?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Three hundred, and a present at that,” was the prompt reply of the man\\r\\nin the red sweater. “And seem’ it’s government money, you ain’t got no\\r\\nkick coming, eh, Perrault?”\\r\\n\\r\\nPerrault grinned. Considering that the price of dogs had been boomed\\r\\nskyward by the unwonted demand, it was not an unfair sum for so fine an\\r\\nanimal. The Canadian Government would be no loser, nor would its\\r\\ndespatches travel the slower. Perrault knew dogs, and when he looked at\\r\\nBuck he knew that he was one in a thousand—“One in ten t’ousand,” he\\r\\ncommented mentally.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck saw money pass between them, and was not surprised when Curly, a\\r\\ngood-natured Newfoundland, and he were led away by the little weazened\\r\\nman. That was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater, and as\\r\\nCurly and he looked at receding Seattle from the deck of the _Narwhal_,\\r\\nit was the last he saw of the warm Southland. Curly and he were taken\\r\\nbelow by Perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called\\r\\nFrançois. Perrault was a French-Canadian, and swarthy; but François was\\r\\na French-Canadian half-breed, and twice as swarthy. They were a new\\r\\nkind of men to Buck (of which he was destined to see many more), and\\r\\nwhile he developed no affection for them, he none the less grew\\r\\nhonestly to respect them. He speedily learned that Perrault and\\r\\nFrançois were fair men, calm and impartial in administering justice,\\r\\nand too wise in the way of dogs to be fooled by dogs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the ’tween-decks of the _Narwhal_, Buck and Curly joined two other\\r\\ndogs. One of them was a big, snow-white fellow from Spitzbergen who had\\r\\nbeen brought away by a whaling captain, and who had later accompanied a\\r\\nGeological Survey into the Barrens. He was friendly, in a treacherous\\r\\nsort of way, smiling into one’s face the while he meditated some\\r\\nunderhand trick, as, for instance, when he stole from Buck’s food at\\r\\nthe first meal. As Buck sprang to punish him, the lash of François’s\\r\\nwhip sang through the air, reaching the culprit first; and nothing\\r\\nremained to Buck but to recover the bone. That was fair of François, he\\r\\ndecided, and the half-breed began his rise in Buck’s estimation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other dog made no advances, nor received any; also, he did not\\r\\nattempt to steal from the newcomers. He was a gloomy, morose fellow,\\r\\nand he showed Curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone,\\r\\nand further, that there would be trouble if he were not left alone.\\r\\n“Dave” he was called, and he ate and slept, or yawned between times,\\r\\nand took interest in nothing, not even when the _Narwhal_ crossed Queen\\r\\nCharlotte Sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing\\r\\npossessed. When Buck and Curly grew excited, half wild with fear, he\\r\\nraised his head as though annoyed, favored them with an incurious\\r\\nglance, yawned, and went to sleep again.\\r\\n\\r\\nDay and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller,\\r\\nand though one day was very like another, it was apparent to Buck that\\r\\nthe weather was steadily growing colder. At last, one morning, the\\r\\npropeller was quiet, and the _Narwhal_ was pervaded with an atmosphere\\r\\nof excitement. He felt it, as did the other dogs, and knew that a\\r\\nchange was at hand. François leashed them and brought them on deck. At\\r\\nthe first step upon the cold surface, Buck’s feet sank into a white\\r\\nmushy something very like mud. He sprang back with a snort. More of\\r\\nthis white stuff was falling through the air. He shook himself, but\\r\\nmore of it fell upon him. He sniffed it curiously, then licked some up\\r\\non his tongue. It bit like fire, and the next instant was gone. This\\r\\npuzzled him. He tried it again, with the same result. The onlookers\\r\\nlaughed uproariously, and he felt ashamed, he knew not why, for it was\\r\\nhis first snow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter II. The Law of Club and Fang\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck’s first day on the Dyea beach was like a nightmare. Every hour was\\r\\nfilled with shock and surprise. He had been suddenly jerked from the\\r\\nheart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial. No\\r\\nlazy, sun-kissed life was this, with nothing to do but loaf and be\\r\\nbored. Here was neither peace, nor rest, nor a moment’s safety. All was\\r\\nconfusion and action, and every moment life and limb were in peril.\\r\\nThere was imperative need to be constantly alert; for these dogs and\\r\\nmen were not town dogs and men. They were savages, all of them, who\\r\\nknew no law but the law of club and fang.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought, and his\\r\\nfirst experience taught him an unforgetable lesson. It is true, it was\\r\\na vicarious experience, else he would not have lived to profit by it.\\r\\nCurly was the victim. They were camped near the log store, where she,\\r\\nin her friendly way, made advances to a husky dog the size of a\\r\\nfull-grown wolf, though not half so large as she. There was no warning,\\r\\nonly a leap in like a flash, a metallic clip of teeth, a leap out\\r\\nequally swift, and Curly’s face was ripped open from eye to jaw.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the wolf manner of fighting, to strike and leap away; but there\\r\\nwas more to it than this. Thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and\\r\\nsurrounded the combatants in an intent and silent circle. Buck did not\\r\\ncomprehend that silent intentness, nor the eager way with which they\\r\\nwere licking their chops. Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again\\r\\nand leaped aside. He met her next rush with his chest, in a peculiar\\r\\nfashion that tumbled her off her feet. She never regained them, This\\r\\nwas what the onlooking huskies had waited for. They closed in upon her,\\r\\nsnarling and yelping, and she was buried, screaming with agony, beneath\\r\\nthe bristling mass of bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo sudden was it, and so unexpected, that Buck was taken aback. He saw\\r\\nSpitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing; and he\\r\\nsaw François, swinging an axe, spring into the mess of dogs. Three men\\r\\nwith clubs were helping him to scatter them. It did not take long. Two\\r\\nminutes from the time Curly went down, the last of her assailants were\\r\\nclubbed off. But she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody,\\r\\ntrampled snow, almost literally torn to pieces, the swart half-breed\\r\\nstanding over her and cursing horribly. The scene often came back to\\r\\nBuck to trouble him in his sleep. So that was the way. No fair play.\\r\\nOnce down, that was the end of you. Well, he would see to it that he\\r\\nnever went down. Spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again, and from\\r\\nthat moment Buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing of\\r\\nCurly, he received another shock. François fastened upon him an\\r\\narrangement of straps and buckles. It was a harness, such as he had\\r\\nseen the grooms put on the horses at home. And as he had seen horses\\r\\nwork, so he was set to work, hauling François on a sled to the forest\\r\\nthat fringed the valley, and returning with a load of firewood. Though\\r\\nhis dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal, he was\\r\\ntoo wise to rebel. He buckled down with a will and did his best, though\\r\\nit was all new and strange. François was stern, demanding instant\\r\\nobedience, and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience; while\\r\\nDave, who was an experienced wheeler, nipped Buck’s hind quarters\\r\\nwhenever he was in error. Spitz was the leader, likewise experienced,\\r\\nand while he could not always get at Buck, he growled sharp reproof now\\r\\nand again, or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk Buck\\r\\ninto the way he should go. Buck learned easily, and under the combined\\r\\ntuition of his two mates and François made remarkable progress. Ere\\r\\nthey returned to camp he knew enough to stop at “ho,” to go ahead at\\r\\n“mush,” to swing wide on the bends, and to keep clear of the wheeler\\r\\nwhen the loaded sled shot downhill at their heels.\\r\\n\\r\\n“T’ree vair’ good dogs,” François told Perrault. “Dat Buck, heem pool\\r\\nlak hell. I tich heem queek as anyt’ing.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBy afternoon, Perrault, who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his\\r\\ndespatches, returned with two more dogs. “Billee” and “Joe” he called\\r\\nthem, two brothers, and true huskies both. Sons of the one mother\\r\\nthough they were, they were as different as day and night. Billee’s one\\r\\nfault was his excessive good nature, while Joe was the very opposite,\\r\\nsour and introspective, with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye.\\r\\nBuck received them in comradely fashion, Dave ignored them, while Spitz\\r\\nproceeded to thrash first one and then the other. Billee wagged his\\r\\ntail appeasingly, turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no\\r\\navail, and cried (still appeasingly) when Spitz’s sharp teeth scored\\r\\nhis flank. But no matter how Spitz circled, Joe whirled around on his\\r\\nheels to face him, mane bristling, ears laid back, lips writhing and\\r\\nsnarling, jaws clipping together as fast as he could snap, and eyes\\r\\ndiabolically gleaming—the incarnation of belligerent fear. So terrible\\r\\nwas his appearance that Spitz was forced to forego disciplining him;\\r\\nbut to cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and\\r\\nwailing Billee and drove him to the confines of the camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy evening Perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean\\r\\nand gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a\\r\\nwarning of prowess that commanded respect. He was called Sol-leks,\\r\\nwhich means the Angry One. Like Dave, he asked nothing, gave nothing,\\r\\nexpected nothing; and when he marched slowly and deliberately into\\r\\ntheir midst, even Spitz left him alone. He had one peculiarity which\\r\\nBuck was unlucky enough to discover. He did not like to be approached\\r\\non his blind side. Of this offence Buck was unwittingly guilty, and the\\r\\nfirst knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when Sol-leks whirled\\r\\nupon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and\\r\\ndown. Forever after Buck avoided his blind side, and to the last of\\r\\ntheir comradeship had no more trouble. His only apparent ambition, like\\r\\nDave’s, was to be left alone; though, as Buck was afterward to learn,\\r\\neach of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night Buck faced the great problem of sleeping. The tent,\\r\\nillumined by a candle, glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain;\\r\\nand when he, as a matter of course, entered it, both Perrault and\\r\\nFrançois bombarded him with curses and cooking utensils, till he\\r\\nrecovered from his consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer\\r\\ncold. A chill wind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with\\r\\nespecial venom into his wounded shoulder. He lay down on the snow and\\r\\nattempted to sleep, but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet.\\r\\nMiserable and disconsolate, he wandered about among the many tents,\\r\\nonly to find that one place was as cold as another. Here and there\\r\\nsavage dogs rushed upon him, but he bristled his neck-hair and snarled\\r\\n(for he was learning fast), and they let him go his way unmolested.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally an idea came to him. He would return and see how his own\\r\\nteam-mates were making out. To his astonishment, they had disappeared.\\r\\nAgain he wandered about through the great camp, looking for them, and\\r\\nagain he returned. Were they in the tent? No, that could not be, else\\r\\nhe would not have been driven out. Then where could they possibly be?\\r\\nWith drooping tail and shivering body, very forlorn indeed, he\\r\\naimlessly circled the tent. Suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore\\r\\nlegs and he sank down. Something wriggled under his feet. He sprang\\r\\nback, bristling and snarling, fearful of the unseen and unknown. But a\\r\\nfriendly little yelp reassured him, and he went back to investigate. A\\r\\nwhiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils, and there, curled up under\\r\\nthe snow in a snug ball, lay Billee. He whined placatingly, squirmed\\r\\nand wriggled to show his good will and intentions, and even ventured,\\r\\nas a bribe for peace, to lick Buck’s face with his warm wet tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother lesson. So that was the way they did it, eh? Buck confidently\\r\\nselected a spot, and with much fuss and waste effort proceeded to dig a\\r\\nhole for himself. In a trice the heat from his body filled the confined\\r\\nspace and he was asleep. The day had been long and arduous, and he\\r\\nslept soundly and comfortably, though he growled and barked and\\r\\nwrestled with bad dreams.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp.\\r\\nAt first he did not know where he was. It had snowed during the night\\r\\nand he was completely buried. The snow walls pressed him on every side,\\r\\nand a great surge of fear swept through him—the fear of the wild thing\\r\\nfor the trap. It was a token that he was harking back through his own\\r\\nlife to the lives of his forebears; for he was a civilized dog, an\\r\\nunduly civilized dog, and of his own experience knew no trap and so\\r\\ncould not of himself fear it. The muscles of his whole body contracted\\r\\nspasmodically and instinctively, the hair on his neck and shoulders\\r\\nstood on end, and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into\\r\\nthe blinding day, the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud. Ere he\\r\\nlanded on his feet, he saw the white camp spread out before him and\\r\\nknew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he\\r\\nwent for a stroll with Manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the\\r\\nnight before.\\r\\n\\r\\nA shout from François hailed his appearance. “Wot I say?” the\\r\\ndog-driver cried to Perrault. “Dat Buck for sure learn queek as\\r\\nanyt’ing.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPerrault nodded gravely. As courier for the Canadian Government,\\r\\nbearing important despatches, he was anxious to secure the best dogs,\\r\\nand he was particularly gladdened by the possession of Buck.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree more huskies were added to the team inside an hour, making a\\r\\ntotal of nine, and before another quarter of an hour had passed they\\r\\nwere in harness and swinging up the trail toward the Dyea Cañon. Buck\\r\\nwas glad to be gone, and though the work was hard he found he did not\\r\\nparticularly despise it. He was surprised at the eagerness which\\r\\nanimated the whole team and which was communicated to him; but still\\r\\nmore surprising was the change wrought in Dave and Sol-leks. They were\\r\\nnew dogs, utterly transformed by the harness. All passiveness and\\r\\nunconcern had dropped from them. They were alert and active, anxious\\r\\nthat the work should go well, and fiercely irritable with whatever, by\\r\\ndelay or confusion, retarded that work. The toil of the traces seemed\\r\\nthe supreme expression of their being, and all that they lived for and\\r\\nthe only thing in which they took delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nDave was wheeler or sled dog, pulling in front of him was Buck, then\\r\\ncame Sol-leks; the rest of the team was strung out ahead, single file,\\r\\nto the leader, which position was filled by Spitz.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck had been purposely placed between Dave and Sol-leks so that he\\r\\nmight receive instruction. Apt scholar that he was, they were equally\\r\\napt teachers, never allowing him to linger long in error, and enforcing\\r\\ntheir teaching with their sharp teeth. Dave was fair and very wise. He\\r\\nnever nipped Buck without cause, and he never failed to nip him when he\\r\\nstood in need of it. As François’s whip backed him up, Buck found it to\\r\\nbe cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate. Once, during a brief\\r\\nhalt, when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start, both\\r\\nDave and Sol-leks flew at him and administered a sound trouncing. The\\r\\nresulting tangle was even worse, but Buck took good care to keep the\\r\\ntraces clear thereafter; and ere the day was done, so well had he\\r\\nmastered his work, his mates about ceased nagging him. François’s whip\\r\\nsnapped less frequently, and Perrault even honored Buck by lifting up\\r\\nhis feet and carefully examining them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a hard day’s run, up the Cañon, through Sheep Camp, past the\\r\\nScales and the timber line, across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of\\r\\nfeet deep, and over the great Chilcoot Divide, which stands between the\\r\\nsalt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely\\r\\nNorth. They made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the\\r\\ncraters of extinct volcanoes, and late that night pulled into the huge\\r\\ncamp at the head of Lake Bennett, where thousands of goldseekers were\\r\\nbuilding boats against the break-up of the ice in the spring. Buck made\\r\\nhis hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just, but all\\r\\ntoo early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his\\r\\nmates to the sled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat day they made forty miles, the trail being packed; but the next\\r\\nday, and for many days to follow, they broke their own trail, worked\\r\\nharder, and made poorer time. As a rule, Perrault travelled ahead of\\r\\nthe team, packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for\\r\\nthem. François, guiding the sled at the gee-pole, sometimes exchanged\\r\\nplaces with him, but not often. Perrault was in a hurry, and he prided\\r\\nhimself on his knowledge of ice, which knowledge was indispensable, for\\r\\nthe fall ice was very thin, and where there was swift water, there was\\r\\nno ice at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nDay after day, for days unending, Buck toiled in the traces. Always,\\r\\nthey broke camp in the dark, and the first gray of dawn found them\\r\\nhitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them. And always\\r\\nthey pitched camp after dark, eating their bit of fish, and crawling to\\r\\nsleep into the snow. Buck was ravenous. The pound and a half of\\r\\nsun-dried salmon, which was his ration for each day, seemed to go\\r\\nnowhere. He never had enough, and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs.\\r\\nYet the other dogs, because they weighed less and were born to the\\r\\nlife, received a pound only of the fish and managed to keep in good\\r\\ncondition.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his old\\r\\nlife. A dainty eater, he found that his mates, finishing first, robbed\\r\\nhim of his unfinished ration. There was no defending it. While he was\\r\\nfighting off two or three, it was disappearing down the throats of the\\r\\nothers. To remedy this, he ate as fast as they; and, so greatly did\\r\\nhunger compel him, he was not above taking what did not belong to him.\\r\\nHe watched and learned. When he saw Pike, one of the new dogs, a clever\\r\\nmalingerer and thief, slyly steal a slice of bacon when Perrault’s back\\r\\nwas turned, he duplicated the performance the following day, getting\\r\\naway with the whole chunk. A great uproar was raised, but he was\\r\\nunsuspected; while Dub, an awkward blunderer who was always getting\\r\\ncaught, was punished for Buck’s misdeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis first theft marked Buck as fit to survive in the hostile Northland\\r\\nenvironment. It marked his adaptability, his capacity to adjust himself\\r\\nto changing conditions, the lack of which would have meant swift and\\r\\nterrible death. It marked, further, the decay or going to pieces of his\\r\\nmoral nature, a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for\\r\\nexistence. It was all well enough in the Southland, under the law of\\r\\nlove and fellowship, to respect private property and personal feelings;\\r\\nbut in the Northland, under the law of club and fang, whoso took such\\r\\nthings into account was a fool, and in so far as he observed them he\\r\\nwould fail to prosper.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot that Buck reasoned it out. He was fit, that was all, and\\r\\nunconsciously he accommodated himself to the new mode of life. All his\\r\\ndays, no matter what the odds, he had never run from a fight. But the\\r\\nclub of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more\\r\\nfundamental and primitive code. Civilized, he could have died for a\\r\\nmoral consideration, say the defence of Judge Miller’s riding-whip; but\\r\\nthe completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by his ability\\r\\nto flee from the defence of a moral consideration and so save his hide.\\r\\nHe did not steal for joy of it, but because of the clamor of his\\r\\nstomach. He did not rob openly, but stole secretly and cunningly, out\\r\\nof respect for club and fang. In short, the things he did were done\\r\\nbecause it was easier to do them than not to do them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis development (or retrogression) was rapid. His muscles became hard\\r\\nas iron, and he grew callous to all ordinary pain. He achieved an\\r\\ninternal as well as external economy. He could eat anything, no matter\\r\\nhow loathsome or indigestible; and, once eaten, the juices of his\\r\\nstomach extracted the last least particle of nutriment; and his blood\\r\\ncarried it to the farthest reaches of his body, building it into the\\r\\ntoughest and stoutest of tissues. Sight and scent became remarkably\\r\\nkeen, while his hearing developed such acuteness that in his sleep he\\r\\nheard the faintest sound and knew whether it heralded peace or peril.\\r\\nHe learned to bite the ice out with his teeth when it collected between\\r\\nhis toes; and when he was thirsty and there was a thick scum of ice\\r\\nover the water hole, he would break it by rearing and striking it with\\r\\nstiff fore legs. His most conspicuous trait was an ability to scent the\\r\\nwind and forecast it a night in advance. No matter how breathless the\\r\\nair when he dug his nest by tree or bank, the wind that later blew\\r\\ninevitably found him to leeward, sheltered and snug.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd not only did he learn by experience, but instincts long dead became\\r\\nalive again. The domesticated generations fell from him. In vague ways\\r\\nhe remembered back to the youth of the breed, to the time the wild dogs\\r\\nranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as\\r\\nthey ran it down. It was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and\\r\\nslash and the quick wolf snap. In this manner had fought forgotten\\r\\nancestors. They quickened the old life within him, and the old tricks\\r\\nwhich they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks.\\r\\nThey came to him without effort or discovery, as though they had been\\r\\nhis always. And when, on the still cold nights, he pointed his nose at\\r\\na star and howled long and wolflike, it was his ancestors, dead and\\r\\ndust, pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and\\r\\nthrough him. And his cadences were their cadences, the cadences which\\r\\nvoiced their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stiffness, and\\r\\nthe cold, and dark.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, as token of what a puppet thing life is, the ancient song surged\\r\\nthrough him and he came into his own again; and he came because men had\\r\\nfound a yellow metal in the North, and because Manuel was a gardener’s\\r\\nhelper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers\\r\\nsmall copies of himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter III. The Dominant Primordial Beast\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dominant primordial beast was strong in Buck, and under the fierce\\r\\nconditions of trail life it grew and grew. Yet it was a secret growth.\\r\\nHis newborn cunning gave him poise and control. He was too busy\\r\\nadjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease, and not only did he\\r\\nnot pick fights, but he avoided them whenever possible. A certain\\r\\ndeliberateness characterized his attitude. He was not prone to rashness\\r\\nand precipitate action; and in the bitter hatred between him and Spitz\\r\\nhe betrayed no impatience, shunned all offensive acts.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, possibly because he divined in Buck a dangerous\\r\\nrival, Spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth. He even\\r\\nwent out of his way to bully Buck, striving constantly to start the\\r\\nfight which could end only in the death of one or the other. Early in\\r\\nthe trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted\\r\\naccident. At the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp\\r\\non the shore of Lake Le Barge. Driving snow, a wind that cut like a\\r\\nwhite-hot knife, and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping\\r\\nplace. They could hardly have fared worse. At their backs rose a\\r\\nperpendicular wall of rock, and Perrault and François were compelled to\\r\\nmake their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake\\r\\nitself. The tent they had discarded at Dyea in order to travel light. A\\r\\nfew sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down\\r\\nthrough the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark.\\r\\n\\r\\nClose in under the sheltering rock Buck made his nest. So snug and warm\\r\\nwas it, that he was loath to leave it when François distributed the\\r\\nfish which he had first thawed over the fire. But when Buck finished\\r\\nhis ration and returned, he found his nest occupied. A warning snarl\\r\\ntold him that the trespasser was Spitz. Till now Buck had avoided\\r\\ntrouble with his enemy, but this was too much. The beast in him roared.\\r\\nHe sprang upon Spitz with a fury which surprised them both, and Spitz\\r\\nparticularly, for his whole experience with Buck had gone to teach him\\r\\nthat his rival was an unusually timid dog, who managed to hold his own\\r\\nonly because of his great weight and size.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrançois was surprised, too, when they shot out in a tangle from the\\r\\ndisrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble. “A-a-ah!” he\\r\\ncried to Buck. “Gif it to heem, by Gar! Gif it to heem, the dirty\\r\\nt’eef!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSpitz was equally willing. He was crying with sheer rage and eagerness\\r\\nas he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in. Buck was no\\r\\nless eager, and no less cautious, as he likewise circled back and forth\\r\\nfor the advantage. But it was then that the unexpected happened, the\\r\\nthing which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future,\\r\\npast many a weary mile of trail and toil.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn oath from Perrault, the resounding impact of a club upon a bony\\r\\nframe, and a shrill yelp of pain, heralded the breaking forth of\\r\\npandemonium. The camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking\\r\\nfurry forms,—starving huskies, four or five score of them, who had\\r\\nscented the camp from some Indian village. They had crept in while Buck\\r\\nand Spitz were fighting, and when the two men sprang among them with\\r\\nstout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back. They were crazed\\r\\nby the smell of the food. Perrault found one with head buried in the\\r\\ngrub-box. His club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs, and the grub-box\\r\\nwas capsized on the ground. On the instant a score of the famished\\r\\nbrutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon. The clubs fell upon\\r\\nthem unheeded. They yelped and howled under the rain of blows, but\\r\\nstruggled none the less madly till the last crumb had been devoured.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime the astonished team-dogs had burst out of their nests\\r\\nonly to be set upon by the fierce invaders. Never had Buck seen such\\r\\ndogs. It seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins.\\r\\nThey were mere skeletons, draped loosely in draggled hides, with\\r\\nblazing eyes and slavered fangs. But the hunger-madness made them\\r\\nterrifying, irresistible. There was no opposing them. The team-dogs\\r\\nwere swept back against the cliff at the first onset. Buck was beset by\\r\\nthree huskies, and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and\\r\\nslashed. The din was frightful. Billee was crying as usual. Dave and\\r\\nSol-leks, dripping blood from a score of wounds, were fighting bravely\\r\\nside by side. Joe was snapping like a demon. Once, his teeth closed on\\r\\nthe fore leg of a husky, and he crunched down through the bone. Pike,\\r\\nthe malingerer, leaped upon the crippled animal, breaking its neck with\\r\\na quick flash of teeth and a jerk, Buck got a frothing adversary by the\\r\\nthroat, and was sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the\\r\\njugular. The warm taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater\\r\\nfierceness. He flung himself upon another, and at the same time felt\\r\\nteeth sink into his own throat. It was Spitz, treacherously attacking\\r\\nfrom the side.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerrault and François, having cleaned out their part of the camp,\\r\\nhurried to save their sled-dogs. The wild wave of famished beasts\\r\\nrolled back before them, and Buck shook himself free. But it was only\\r\\nfor a moment. The two men were compelled to run back to save the grub,\\r\\nupon which the huskies returned to the attack on the team. Billee,\\r\\nterrified into bravery, sprang through the savage circle and fled away\\r\\nover the ice. Pike and Dub followed on his heels, with the rest of the\\r\\nteam behind. As Buck drew himself together to spring after them, out of\\r\\nthe tail of his eye he saw Spitz rush upon him with the evident\\r\\nintention of overthrowing him. Once off his feet and under that mass of\\r\\nhuskies, there was no hope for him. But he braced himself to the shock\\r\\nof Spitz’s charge, then joined the flight out on the lake.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, the nine team-dogs gathered together and sought shelter in the\\r\\nforest. Though unpursued, they were in a sorry plight. There was not\\r\\none who was not wounded in four or five places, while some were wounded\\r\\ngrievously. Dub was badly injured in a hind leg; Dolly, the last husky\\r\\nadded to the team at Dyea, had a badly torn throat; Joe had lost an\\r\\neye; while Billee, the good-natured, with an ear chewed and rent to\\r\\nribbons, cried and whimpered throughout the night. At daybreak they\\r\\nlimped warily back to camp, to find the marauders gone and the two men\\r\\nin bad tempers. Fully half their grub supply was gone. The huskies had\\r\\nchewed through the sled lashings and canvas coverings. In fact,\\r\\nnothing, no matter how remotely eatable, had escaped them. They had\\r\\neaten a pair of Perrault’s moose-hide moccasins, chunks out of the\\r\\nleather traces, and even two feet of lash from the end of François’s\\r\\nwhip. He broke from a mournful contemplation of it to look over his\\r\\nwounded dogs.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, my frien’s,” he said softly, “mebbe it mek you mad dog, dose many\\r\\nbites. Mebbe all mad dog, sacredam! Wot you t’ink, eh, Perrault?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe courier shook his head dubiously. With four hundred miles of trail\\r\\nstill between him and Dawson, he could ill afford to have madness break\\r\\nout among his dogs. Two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses\\r\\ninto shape, and the wound-stiffened team was under way, struggling\\r\\npainfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered,\\r\\nand for that matter, the hardest between them and Dawson.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Thirty Mile River was wide open. Its wild water defied the frost,\\r\\nand it was in the eddies only and in the quiet places that the ice held\\r\\nat all. Six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty\\r\\nterrible miles. And terrible they were, for every foot of them was\\r\\naccomplished at the risk of life to dog and man. A dozen times,\\r\\nPerrault, nosing the way broke through the ice bridges, being saved by\\r\\nthe long pole he carried, which he so held that it fell each time\\r\\nacross the hole made by his body. But a cold snap was on, the\\r\\nthermometer registering fifty below zero, and each time he broke\\r\\nthrough he was compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his\\r\\ngarments.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing daunted him. It was because nothing daunted him that he had\\r\\nbeen chosen for government courier. He took all manner of risks,\\r\\nresolutely thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and\\r\\nstruggling on from dim dawn to dark. He skirted the frowning shores on\\r\\nrim ice that bent and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not\\r\\nhalt. Once, the sled broke through, with Dave and Buck, and they were\\r\\nhalf-frozen and all but drowned by the time they were dragged out. The\\r\\nusual fire was necessary to save them. They were coated solidly with\\r\\nice, and the two men kept them on the run around the fire, sweating and\\r\\nthawing, so close that they were singed by the flames.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt another time Spitz went through, dragging the whole team after him\\r\\nup to Buck, who strained backward with all his strength, his fore paws\\r\\non the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around. But\\r\\nbehind him was Dave, likewise straining backward, and behind the sled\\r\\nwas François, pulling till his tendons cracked.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, the rim ice broke away before and behind, and there was no\\r\\nescape except up the cliff. Perrault scaled it by a miracle, while\\r\\nFrançois prayed for just that miracle; and with every thong and sled\\r\\nlashing and the last bit of harness rove into a long rope, the dogs\\r\\nwere hoisted, one by one, to the cliff crest. François came up last,\\r\\nafter the sled and load. Then came the search for a place to descend,\\r\\nwhich descent was ultimately made by the aid of the rope, and night\\r\\nfound them back on the river with a quarter of a mile to the day’s\\r\\ncredit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time they made the Hootalinqua and good ice, Buck was played\\r\\nout. The rest of the dogs were in like condition; but Perrault, to make\\r\\nup lost time, pushed them late and early. The first day they covered\\r\\nthirty-five miles to the Big Salmon; the next day thirty-five more to\\r\\nthe Little Salmon; the third day forty miles, which brought them well\\r\\nup toward the Five Fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck’s feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies.\\r\\nHis had softened during the many generations since the day his last\\r\\nwild ancestor was tamed by a cave-dweller or river man. All day long he\\r\\nlimped in agony, and camp once made, lay down like a dead dog. Hungry\\r\\nas he was, he would not move to receive his ration of fish, which\\r\\nFrançois had to bring to him. Also, the dog-driver rubbed Buck’s feet\\r\\nfor half an hour each night after supper, and sacrificed the tops of\\r\\nhis own moccasins to make four moccasins for Buck. This was a great\\r\\nrelief, and Buck caused even the weazened face of Perrault to twist\\r\\nitself into a grin one morning, when François forgot the moccasins and\\r\\nBuck lay on his back, his four feet waving appealingly in the air, and\\r\\nrefused to budge without them. Later his feet grew hard to the trail,\\r\\nand the worn-out foot-gear was thrown away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the Pelly one morning, as they were harnessing up, Dolly, who had\\r\\nnever been conspicuous for anything, went suddenly mad. She announced\\r\\nher condition by a long, heartbreaking wolf howl that sent every dog\\r\\nbristling with fear, then sprang straight for Buck. He had never seen a\\r\\ndog go mad, nor did he have any reason to fear madness; yet he knew\\r\\nthat here was horror, and fled away from it in a panic. Straight away\\r\\nhe raced, with Dolly, panting and frothing, one leap behind; nor could\\r\\nshe gain on him, so great was his terror, nor could he leave her, so\\r\\ngreat was her madness. He plunged through the wooded breast of the\\r\\nisland, flew down to the lower end, crossed a back channel filled with\\r\\nrough ice to another island, gained a third island, curved back to the\\r\\nmain river, and in desperation started to cross it. And all the time,\\r\\nthough he did not look, he could hear her snarling just one leap\\r\\nbehind. François called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled\\r\\nback, still one leap ahead, gasping painfully for air and putting all\\r\\nhis faith in that François would save him. The dog-driver held the axe\\r\\npoised in his hand, and as Buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon\\r\\nmad Dolly’s head.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck staggered over against the sled, exhausted, sobbing for breath,\\r\\nhelpless. This was Spitz’s opportunity. He sprang upon Buck, and twice\\r\\nhis teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh\\r\\nto the bone. Then François’s lash descended, and Buck had the\\r\\nsatisfaction of watching Spitz receive the worst whipping as yet\\r\\nadministered to any of the teams.\\r\\n\\r\\n“One devil, dat Spitz,” remarked Perrault. “Some dam day heem keel dat\\r\\nBuck.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dat Buck two devils,” was François’s rejoinder. “All de tam I watch\\r\\ndat Buck I know for sure. Lissen: some dam fine day heem get mad lak\\r\\nhell an’ den heem chew dat Spitz all up an’ spit heem out on de snow.\\r\\nSure. I know.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom then on it was war between them. Spitz, as lead-dog and\\r\\nacknowledged master of the team, felt his supremacy threatened by this\\r\\nstrange Southland dog. And strange Buck was to him, for of the many\\r\\nSouthland dogs he had known, not one had shown up worthily in camp and\\r\\non trail. They were all too soft, dying under the toil, the frost, and\\r\\nstarvation. Buck was the exception. He alone endured and prospered,\\r\\nmatching the husky in strength, savagery, and cunning. Then he was a\\r\\nmasterful dog, and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club\\r\\nof the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness\\r\\nout of his desire for mastery. He was preeminently cunning, and could\\r\\nbide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come. Buck\\r\\nwanted it. He wanted it because it was his nature, because he had been\\r\\ngripped tight by that nameless, incomprehensible pride of the trail and\\r\\ntrace—that pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp, which\\r\\nlures them to die joyfully in the harness, and breaks their hearts if\\r\\nthey are cut out of the harness. This was the pride of Dave as\\r\\nwheel-dog, of Sol-leks as he pulled with all his strength; the pride\\r\\nthat laid hold of them at break of camp, transforming them from sour\\r\\nand sullen brutes into straining, eager, ambitious creatures; the pride\\r\\nthat spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at\\r\\nnight, letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and uncontent. This\\r\\nwas the pride that bore up Spitz and made him thrash the sled-dogs who\\r\\nblundered and shirked in the traces or hid away at harness-up time in\\r\\nthe morning. Likewise it was this pride that made him fear Buck as a\\r\\npossible lead-dog. And this was Buck’s pride, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe openly threatened the other’s leadership. He came between him and\\r\\nthe shirks he should have punished. And he did it deliberately. One\\r\\nnight there was a heavy snowfall, and in the morning Pike, the\\r\\nmalingerer, did not appear. He was securely hidden in his nest under a\\r\\nfoot of snow. François called him and sought him in vain. Spitz was\\r\\nwild with wrath. He raged through the camp, smelling and digging in\\r\\nevery likely place, snarling so frightfully that Pike heard and\\r\\nshivered in his hiding-place.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when he was at last unearthed, and Spitz flew at him to punish him,\\r\\nBuck flew, with equal rage, in between. So unexpected was it, and so\\r\\nshrewdly managed, that Spitz was hurled backward and off his feet.\\r\\nPike, who had been trembling abjectly, took heart at this open mutiny,\\r\\nand sprang upon his overthrown leader. Buck, to whom fair play was a\\r\\nforgotten code, likewise sprang upon Spitz. But François, chuckling at\\r\\nthe incident while unswerving in the administration of justice, brought\\r\\nhis lash down upon Buck with all his might. This failed to drive Buck\\r\\nfrom his prostrate rival, and the butt of the whip was brought into\\r\\nplay. Half-stunned by the blow, Buck was knocked backward and the lash\\r\\nlaid upon him again and again, while Spitz soundly punished the many\\r\\ntimes offending Pike.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the days that followed, as Dawson grew closer and closer, Buck still\\r\\ncontinued to interfere between Spitz and the culprits; but he did it\\r\\ncraftily, when François was not around, With the covert mutiny of Buck,\\r\\na general insubordination sprang up and increased. Dave and Sol-leks\\r\\nwere unaffected, but the rest of the team went from bad to worse.\\r\\nThings no longer went right. There was continual bickering and\\r\\njangling. Trouble was always afoot, and at the bottom of it was Buck.\\r\\nHe kept François busy, for the dog-driver was in constant apprehension\\r\\nof the life-and-death struggle between the two which he knew must take\\r\\nplace sooner or later; and on more than one night the sounds of\\r\\nquarrelling and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his\\r\\nsleeping robe, fearful that Buck and Spitz were at it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the opportunity did not present itself, and they pulled into Dawson\\r\\none dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come. Here were many\\r\\nmen, and countless dogs, and Buck found them all at work. It seemed the\\r\\nordained order of things that dogs should work. All day they swung up\\r\\nand down the main street in long teams, and in the night their jingling\\r\\nbells still went by. They hauled cabin logs and firewood, freighted up\\r\\nto the mines, and did all manner of work that horses did in the Santa\\r\\nClara Valley. Here and there Buck met Southland dogs, but in the main\\r\\nthey were the wild wolf husky breed. Every night, regularly, at nine,\\r\\nat twelve, at three, they lifted a nocturnal song, a weird and eerie\\r\\nchant, in which it was Buck’s delight to join.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead, or the stars leaping\\r\\nin the frost dance, and the land numb and frozen under its pall of\\r\\nsnow, this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life,\\r\\nonly it was pitched in minor key, with long-drawn wailings and\\r\\nhalf-sobs, and was more the pleading of life, the articulate travail of\\r\\nexistence. It was an old song, old as the breed itself—one of the first\\r\\nsongs of the younger world in a day when songs were sad. It was\\r\\ninvested with the woe of unnumbered generations, this plaint by which\\r\\nBuck was so strangely stirred. When he moaned and sobbed, it was with\\r\\nthe pain of living that was of old the pain of his wild fathers, and\\r\\nthe fear and mystery of the cold and dark that was to them fear and\\r\\nmystery. And that he should be stirred by it marked the completeness\\r\\nwith which he harked back through the ages of fire and roof to the raw\\r\\nbeginnings of life in the howling ages.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven days from the time they pulled into Dawson, they dropped down the\\r\\nsteep bank by the Barracks to the Yukon Trail, and pulled for Dyea and\\r\\nSalt Water. Perrault was carrying despatches if anything more urgent\\r\\nthan those he had brought in; also, the travel pride had gripped him,\\r\\nand he purposed to make the record trip of the year. Several things\\r\\nfavored him in this. The week’s rest had recuperated the dogs and put\\r\\nthem in thorough trim. The trail they had broken into the country was\\r\\npacked hard by later journeyers. And further, the police had arranged\\r\\nin two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man, and he was\\r\\ntravelling light.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey made Sixty Mile, which is a fifty-mile run, on the first day; and\\r\\nthe second day saw them booming up the Yukon well on their way to\\r\\nPelly. But such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble\\r\\nand vexation on the part of François. The insidious revolt led by Buck\\r\\nhad destroyed the solidarity of the team. It no longer was as one dog\\r\\nleaping in the traces. The encouragement Buck gave the rebels led them\\r\\ninto all kinds of petty misdemeanors. No more was Spitz a leader\\r\\ngreatly to be feared. The old awe departed, and they grew equal to\\r\\nchallenging his authority. Pike robbed him of half a fish one night,\\r\\nand gulped it down under the protection of Buck. Another night Dub and\\r\\nJoe fought Spitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved. And\\r\\neven Billee, the good-natured, was less good-natured, and whined not\\r\\nhalf so placatingly as in former days. Buck never came near Spitz\\r\\nwithout snarling and bristling menacingly. In fact, his conduct\\r\\napproached that of a bully, and he was given to swaggering up and down\\r\\nbefore Spitz’s very nose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their\\r\\nrelations with one another. They quarrelled and bickered more than ever\\r\\namong themselves, till at times the camp was a howling bedlam. Dave and\\r\\nSol-leks alone were unaltered, though they were made irritable by the\\r\\nunending squabbling. François swore strange barbarous oaths, and\\r\\nstamped the snow in futile rage, and tore his hair. His lash was always\\r\\nsinging among the dogs, but it was of small avail. Directly his back\\r\\nwas turned they were at it again. He backed up Spitz with his whip,\\r\\nwhile Buck backed up the remainder of the team. François knew he was\\r\\nbehind all the trouble, and Buck knew he knew; but Buck was too clever\\r\\never again to be caught red-handed. He worked faithfully in the\\r\\nharness, for the toil had become a delight to him; yet it was a greater\\r\\ndelight slyly to precipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the\\r\\ntraces.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the mouth of the Tahkeena, one night after supper, Dub turned up a\\r\\nsnowshoe rabbit, blundered it, and missed. In a second the whole team\\r\\nwas in full cry. A hundred yards away was a camp of the Northwest\\r\\nPolice, with fifty dogs, huskies all, who joined the chase. The rabbit\\r\\nsped down the river, turned off into a small creek, up the frozen bed\\r\\nof which it held steadily. It ran lightly on the surface of the snow,\\r\\nwhile the dogs ploughed through by main strength. Buck led the pack,\\r\\nsixty strong, around bend after bend, but he could not gain. He lay\\r\\ndown low to the race, whining eagerly, his splendid body flashing\\r\\nforward, leap by leap, in the wan white moonlight. And leap by leap,\\r\\nlike some pale frost wraith, the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men\\r\\nout from the sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things by\\r\\nchemically propelled leaden pellets, the blood lust, the joy to\\r\\nkill—all this was Buck’s, only it was infinitely more intimate. He was\\r\\nranging at the head of the pack, running the wild thing down, the\\r\\nliving meat, to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes\\r\\nin warm blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which\\r\\nlife cannot rise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes\\r\\nwhen one is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that\\r\\none is alive. This ecstasy, this forgetfulness of living, comes to the\\r\\nartist, caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame; it comes to\\r\\nthe soldier, war-mad on a stricken field and refusing quarter; and it\\r\\ncame to Buck, leading the pack, sounding the old wolf-cry, straining\\r\\nafter the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through\\r\\nthe moonlight. He was sounding the deeps of his nature, and of the\\r\\nparts of his nature that were deeper than he, going back into the womb\\r\\nof Time. He was mastered by the sheer surging of life, the tidal wave\\r\\nof being, the perfect joy of each separate muscle, joint, and sinew in\\r\\nthat it was everything that was not death, that it was aglow and\\r\\nrampant, expressing itself in movement, flying exultantly under the\\r\\nstars and over the face of dead matter that did not move.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Spitz, cold and calculating even in his supreme moods, left the\\r\\npack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long\\r\\nbend around. Buck did not know of this, and as he rounded the bend, the\\r\\nfrost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him, he saw another and\\r\\nlarger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate\\r\\npath of the rabbit. It was Spitz. The rabbit could not turn, and as the\\r\\nwhite teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a\\r\\nstricken man may shriek. At sound of this, the cry of Life plunging\\r\\ndown from Life’s apex in the grip of Death, the fall pack at Buck’s\\r\\nheels raised a hell’s chorus of delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck did not cry out. He did not check himself, but drove in upon\\r\\nSpitz, shoulder to shoulder, so hard that he missed the throat. They\\r\\nrolled over and over in the powdery snow. Spitz gained his feet almost\\r\\nas though he had not been overthrown, slashing Buck down the shoulder\\r\\nand leaping clear. Twice his teeth clipped together, like the steel\\r\\njaws of a trap, as he backed away for better footing, with lean and\\r\\nlifting lips that writhed and snarled.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a flash Buck knew it. The time had come. It was to the death. As\\r\\nthey circled about, snarling, ears laid back, keenly watchful for the\\r\\nadvantage, the scene came to Buck with a sense of familiarity. He\\r\\nseemed to remember it all,—the white woods, and earth, and moonlight,\\r\\nand the thrill of battle. Over the whiteness and silence brooded a\\r\\nghostly calm. There was not the faintest whisper of air—nothing moved,\\r\\nnot a leaf quivered, the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and\\r\\nlingering in the frosty air. They had made short work of the snowshoe\\r\\nrabbit, these dogs that were ill-tamed wolves; and they were now drawn\\r\\nup in an expectant circle. They, too, were silent, their eyes only\\r\\ngleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward. To Buck it was\\r\\nnothing new or strange, this scene of old time. It was as though it had\\r\\nalways been, the wonted way of things.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpitz was a practised fighter. From Spitzbergen through the Arctic, and\\r\\nacross Canada and the Barrens, he had held his own with all manner of\\r\\ndogs and achieved to mastery over them. Bitter rage was his, but never\\r\\nblind rage. In passion to rend and destroy, he never forgot that his\\r\\nenemy was in like passion to rend and destroy. He never rushed till he\\r\\nwas prepared to receive a rush; never attacked till he had first\\r\\ndefended that attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain Buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog.\\r\\nWherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh, they were countered by\\r\\nthe fangs of Spitz. Fang clashed fang, and lips were cut and bleeding,\\r\\nbut Buck could not penetrate his enemy’s guard. Then he warmed up and\\r\\nenveloped Spitz in a whirlwind of rushes. Time and time again he tried\\r\\nfor the snow-white throat, where life bubbled near to the surface, and\\r\\neach time and every time Spitz slashed him and got away. Then Buck took\\r\\nto rushing, as though for the throat, when, suddenly drawing back his\\r\\nhead and curving in from the side, he would drive his shoulder at the\\r\\nshoulder of Spitz, as a ram by which to overthrow him. But instead,\\r\\nBuck’s shoulder was slashed down each time as Spitz leaped lightly\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpitz was untouched, while Buck was streaming with blood and panting\\r\\nhard. The fight was growing desperate. And all the while the silent and\\r\\nwolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down. As Buck\\r\\ngrew winded, Spitz took to rushing, and he kept him staggering for\\r\\nfooting. Once Buck went over, and the whole circle of sixty dogs\\r\\nstarted up; but he recovered himself, almost in mid air, and the circle\\r\\nsank down again and waited.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Buck possessed a quality that made for greatness—imagination. He\\r\\nfought by instinct, but he could fight by head as well. He rushed, as\\r\\nthough attempting the old shoulder trick, but at the last instant swept\\r\\nlow to the snow and in. His teeth closed on Spitz’s left fore leg.\\r\\nThere was a crunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him on\\r\\nthree legs. Thrice he tried to knock him over, then repeated the trick\\r\\nand broke the right fore leg. Despite the pain and helplessness, Spitz\\r\\nstruggled madly to keep up. He saw the silent circle, with gleaming\\r\\neyes, lolling tongues, and silvery breaths drifting upward, closing in\\r\\nupon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten\\r\\nantagonists in the past. Only this time he was the one who was beaten.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no hope for him. Buck was inexorable. Mercy was a thing\\r\\nreserved for gentler climes. He manœuvred for the final rush. The\\r\\ncircle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on\\r\\nhis flanks. He could see them, beyond Spitz and to either side, half\\r\\ncrouching for the spring, their eyes fixed upon him. A pause seemed to\\r\\nfall. Every animal was motionless as though turned to stone. Only Spitz\\r\\nquivered and bristled as he staggered back and forth, snarling with\\r\\nhorrible menace, as though to frighten off impending death. Then Buck\\r\\nsprang in and out; but while he was in, shoulder had at last squarely\\r\\nmet shoulder. The dark circle became a dot on the moon-flooded snow as\\r\\nSpitz disappeared from view. Buck stood and looked on, the successful\\r\\nchampion, the dominant primordial beast who had made his kill and found\\r\\nit good.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter IV. Who Has Won to Mastership\\r\\n\\r\\n“Eh? Wot I say? I spik true w’en I say dat Buck two devils.” This was\\r\\nFrançois’s speech next morning when he discovered Spitz missing and\\r\\nBuck covered with wounds. He drew him to the fire and by its light\\r\\npointed them out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dat Spitz fight lak hell,” said Perrault, as he surveyed the gaping\\r\\nrips and cuts.\\r\\n\\r\\n“An’ dat Buck fight lak two hells,” was François’s answer. “An’ now we\\r\\nmake good time. No more Spitz, no more trouble, sure.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Perrault packed the camp outfit and loaded the sled, the\\r\\ndog-driver proceeded to harness the dogs. Buck trotted up to the place\\r\\nSpitz would have occupied as leader; but François, not noticing him,\\r\\nbrought Sol-leks to the coveted position. In his judgment, Sol-leks was\\r\\nthe best lead-dog left. Buck sprang upon Sol-leks in a fury, driving\\r\\nhim back and standing in his place.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Eh? eh?” François cried, slapping his thighs gleefully. “Look at dat\\r\\nBuck. Heem keel dat Spitz, heem t’ink to take de job.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go ’way, Chook!” he cried, but Buck refused to budge.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took Buck by the scruff of the neck, and though the dog growled\\r\\nthreateningly, dragged him to one side and replaced Sol-leks. The old\\r\\ndog did not like it, and showed plainly that he was afraid of Buck.\\r\\nFrançois was obdurate, but when he turned his back Buck again displaced\\r\\nSol-leks, who was not at all unwilling to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrançois was angry. “Now, by Gar, I feex you!” he cried, coming back\\r\\nwith a heavy club in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck remembered the man in the red sweater, and retreated slowly; nor\\r\\ndid he attempt to charge in when Sol-leks was once more brought\\r\\nforward. But he circled just beyond the range of the club, snarling\\r\\nwith bitterness and rage; and while he circled he watched the club so\\r\\nas to dodge it if thrown by François, for he was become wise in the way\\r\\nof clubs. The driver went about his work, and he called to Buck when he\\r\\nwas ready to put him in his old place in front of Dave. Buck retreated\\r\\ntwo or three steps. François followed him up, whereupon he again\\r\\nretreated. After some time of this, François threw down the club,\\r\\nthinking that Buck feared a thrashing. But Buck was in open revolt. He\\r\\nwanted, not to escape a clubbing, but to have the leadership. It was\\r\\nhis by right. He had earned it, and he would not be content with less.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerrault took a hand. Between them they ran him about for the better\\r\\npart of an hour. They threw clubs at him. He dodged. They cursed him,\\r\\nand his fathers and mothers before him, and all his seed to come after\\r\\nhim down to the remotest generation, and every hair on his body and\\r\\ndrop of blood in his veins; and he answered curse with snarl and kept\\r\\nout of their reach. He did not try to run away, but retreated around\\r\\nand around the camp, advertising plainly that when his desire was met,\\r\\nhe would come in and be good.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrançois sat down and scratched his head. Perrault looked at his watch\\r\\nand swore. Time was flying, and they should have been on the trail an\\r\\nhour gone. François scratched his head again. He shook it and grinned\\r\\nsheepishly at the courier, who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they\\r\\nwere beaten. Then François went up to where Sol-leks stood and called\\r\\nto Buck. Buck laughed, as dogs laugh, yet kept his distance. François\\r\\nunfastened Sol-leks’s traces and put him back in his old place. The\\r\\nteam stood harnessed to the sled in an unbroken line, ready for the\\r\\ntrail. There was no place for Buck save at the front. Once more\\r\\nFrançois called, and once more Buck laughed and kept away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“T’row down de club,” Perrault commanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrançois complied, whereupon Buck trotted in, laughing triumphantly,\\r\\nand swung around into position at the head of the team. His traces were\\r\\nfastened, the sled broken out, and with both men running they dashed\\r\\nout on to the river trail.\\r\\n\\r\\nHighly as the dog-driver had forevalued Buck, with his two devils, he\\r\\nfound, while the day was yet young, that he had undervalued. At a bound\\r\\nBuck took up the duties of leadership; and where judgment was required,\\r\\nand quick thinking and quick acting, he showed himself the superior\\r\\neven of Spitz, of whom François had never seen an equal.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was in giving the law and making his mates live up to it, that\\r\\nBuck excelled. Dave and Sol-leks did not mind the change in leadership.\\r\\nIt was none of their business. Their business was to toil, and toil\\r\\nmightily, in the traces. So long as that were not interfered with, they\\r\\ndid not care what happened. Billee, the good-natured, could lead for\\r\\nall they cared, so long as he kept order. The rest of the team,\\r\\nhowever, had grown unruly during the last days of Spitz, and their\\r\\nsurprise was great now that Buck proceeded to lick them into shape.\\r\\n\\r\\nPike, who pulled at Buck’s heels, and who never put an ounce more of\\r\\nhis weight against the breast-band than he was compelled to do, was\\r\\nswiftly and repeatedly shaken for loafing; and ere the first day was\\r\\ndone he was pulling more than ever before in his life. The first night\\r\\nin camp, Joe, the sour one, was punished roundly—a thing that Spitz had\\r\\nnever succeeded in doing. Buck simply smothered him by virtue of\\r\\nsuperior weight, and cut him up till he ceased snapping and began to\\r\\nwhine for mercy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general tone of the team picked up immediately. It recovered its\\r\\nold-time solidarity, and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in the\\r\\ntraces. At the Rink Rapids two native huskies, Teek and Koona, were\\r\\nadded; and the celerity with which Buck broke them in took away\\r\\nFrançois’s breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nevaire such a dog as dat Buck!” he cried. “No, nevaire! Heem worth\\r\\none t’ousan’ dollair, by Gar! Eh? Wot you say, Perrault?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Perrault nodded. He was ahead of the record then, and gaining day\\r\\nby day. The trail was in excellent condition, well packed and hard, and\\r\\nthere was no new-fallen snow with which to contend. It was not too\\r\\ncold. The temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there\\r\\nthe whole trip. The men rode and ran by turn, and the dogs were kept on\\r\\nthe jump, with but infrequent stoppages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Thirty Mile River was comparatively coated with ice, and they\\r\\ncovered in one day going out what had taken them ten days coming in. In\\r\\none run they made a sixty-mile dash from the foot of Lake Le Barge to\\r\\nthe White Horse Rapids. Across Marsh, Tagish, and Bennett (seventy\\r\\nmiles of lakes), they flew so fast that the man whose turn it was to\\r\\nrun towed behind the sled at the end of a rope. And on the last night\\r\\nof the second week they topped White Pass and dropped down the sea\\r\\nslope with the lights of Skaguay and of the shipping at their feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a record run. Each day for fourteen days they had averaged forty\\r\\nmiles. For three days Perrault and François threw chests up and down\\r\\nthe main street of Skaguay and were deluged with invitations to drink,\\r\\nwhile the team was the constant centre of a worshipful crowd of\\r\\ndog-busters and mushers. Then three or four western bad men aspired to\\r\\nclean out the town, were riddled like pepper-boxes for their pains, and\\r\\npublic interest turned to other idols. Next came official orders.\\r\\nFrançois called Buck to him, threw his arms around him, wept over him.\\r\\nAnd that was the last of François and Perrault. Like other men, they\\r\\npassed out of Buck’s life for good.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Scotch half-breed took charge of him and his mates, and in company\\r\\nwith a dozen other dog-teams he started back over the weary trail to\\r\\nDawson. It was no light running now, nor record time, but heavy toil\\r\\neach day, with a heavy load behind; for this was the mail train,\\r\\ncarrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the\\r\\nshadow of the Pole.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck did not like it, but he bore up well to the work, taking pride in\\r\\nit after the manner of Dave and Sol-leks, and seeing that his mates,\\r\\nwhether they prided in it or not, did their fair share. It was a\\r\\nmonotonous life, operating with machine-like regularity. One day was\\r\\nvery like another. At a certain time each morning the cooks turned out,\\r\\nfires were built, and breakfast was eaten. Then, while some broke camp,\\r\\nothers harnessed the dogs, and they were under way an hour or so before\\r\\nthe darkness fell which gave warning of dawn. At night, camp was made.\\r\\nSome pitched the flies, others cut firewood and pine boughs for the\\r\\nbeds, and still others carried water or ice for the cooks. Also, the\\r\\ndogs were fed. To them, this was the one feature of the day, though it\\r\\nwas good to loaf around, after the fish was eaten, for an hour or so\\r\\nwith the other dogs, of which there were fivescore and odd. There were\\r\\nfierce fighters among them, but three battles with the fiercest brought\\r\\nBuck to mastery, so that when he bristled and showed his teeth they got\\r\\nout of his way.\\r\\n\\r\\nBest of all, perhaps, he loved to lie near the fire, hind legs crouched\\r\\nunder him, fore legs stretched out in front, head raised, and eyes\\r\\nblinking dreamily at the flames. Sometimes he thought of Judge Miller’s\\r\\nbig house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley, and of the cement\\r\\nswimming-tank, and Ysabel, the Mexican hairless, and Toots, the\\r\\nJapanese pug; but oftener he remembered the man in the red sweater, the\\r\\ndeath of Curly, the great fight with Spitz, and the good things he had\\r\\neaten or would like to eat. He was not homesick. The Sunland was very\\r\\ndim and distant, and such memories had no power over him. Far more\\r\\npotent were the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never\\r\\nseen before a seeming familiarity; the instincts (which were but the\\r\\nmemories of his ancestors become habits) which had lapsed in later\\r\\ndays, and still later, in him, quickened and become alive again.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes as he crouched there, blinking dreamily at the flames, it\\r\\nseemed that the flames were of another fire, and that as he crouched by\\r\\nthis other fire he saw another and different man from the half-breed\\r\\ncook before him. This other man was shorter of leg and longer of arm,\\r\\nwith muscles that were stringy and knotty rather than rounded and\\r\\nswelling. The hair of this man was long and matted, and his head\\r\\nslanted back under it from the eyes. He uttered strange sounds, and\\r\\nseemed very much afraid of the darkness, into which he peered\\r\\ncontinually, clutching in his hand, which hung midway between knee and\\r\\nfoot, a stick with a heavy stone made fast to the end. He was all but\\r\\nnaked, a ragged and fire-scorched skin hanging part way down his back,\\r\\nbut on his body there was much hair. In some places, across the chest\\r\\nand shoulders and down the outside of the arms and thighs, it was\\r\\nmatted into almost a thick fur. He did not stand erect, but with trunk\\r\\ninclined forward from the hips, on legs that bent at the knees. About\\r\\nhis body there was a peculiar springiness, or resiliency, almost\\r\\ncatlike, and a quick alertness as of one who lived in perpetual fear of\\r\\nthings seen and unseen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt other times this hairy man squatted by the fire with head between\\r\\nhis legs and slept. On such occasions his elbows were on his knees, his\\r\\nhands clasped above his head as though to shed rain by the hairy arms.\\r\\nAnd beyond that fire, in the circling darkness, Buck could see many\\r\\ngleaming coals, two by two, always two by two, which he knew to be the\\r\\neyes of great beasts of prey. And he could hear the crashing of their\\r\\nbodies through the undergrowth, and the noises they made in the night.\\r\\nAnd dreaming there by the Yukon bank, with lazy eyes blinking at the\\r\\nfire, these sounds and sights of another world would make the hair to\\r\\nrise along his back and stand on end across his shoulders and up his\\r\\nneck, till he whimpered low and suppressedly, or growled softly, and\\r\\nthe half-breed cook shouted at him, “Hey, you Buck, wake up!” Whereupon\\r\\nthe other world would vanish and the real world come into his eyes, and\\r\\nhe would get up and yawn and stretch as though he had been asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a hard trip, with the mail behind them, and the heavy work wore\\r\\nthem down. They were short of weight and in poor condition when they\\r\\nmade Dawson, and should have had a ten days’ or a week’s rest at least.\\r\\nBut in two days’ time they dropped down the Yukon bank from the\\r\\nBarracks, loaded with letters for the outside. The dogs were tired, the\\r\\ndrivers grumbling, and to make matters worse, it snowed every day. This\\r\\nmeant a soft trail, greater friction on the runners, and heavier\\r\\npulling for the dogs; yet the drivers were fair through it all, and did\\r\\ntheir best for the animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach night the dogs were attended to first. They ate before the drivers\\r\\nate, and no man sought his sleeping-robe till he had seen to the feet\\r\\nof the dogs he drove. Still, their strength went down. Since the\\r\\nbeginning of the winter they had travelled eighteen hundred miles,\\r\\ndragging sleds the whole weary distance; and eighteen hundred miles\\r\\nwill tell upon life of the toughest. Buck stood it, keeping his mates\\r\\nup to their work and maintaining discipline, though he, too, was very\\r\\ntired. Billee cried and whimpered regularly in his sleep each night.\\r\\nJoe was sourer than ever, and Sol-leks was unapproachable, blind side\\r\\nor other side.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was Dave who suffered most of all. Something had gone wrong with\\r\\nhim. He became more morose and irritable, and when camp was pitched at\\r\\nonce made his nest, where his driver fed him. Once out of the harness\\r\\nand down, he did not get on his feet again till harness-up time in the\\r\\nmorning. Sometimes, in the traces, when jerked by a sudden stoppage of\\r\\nthe sled, or by straining to start it, he would cry out with pain. The\\r\\ndriver examined him, but could find nothing. All the drivers became\\r\\ninterested in his case. They talked it over at meal-time, and over\\r\\ntheir last pipes before going to bed, and one night they held a\\r\\nconsultation. He was brought from his nest to the fire and was pressed\\r\\nand prodded till he cried out many times. Something was wrong inside,\\r\\nbut they could locate no broken bones, could not make it out.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time Cassiar Bar was reached, he was so weak that he was falling\\r\\nrepeatedly in the traces. The Scotch half-breed called a halt and took\\r\\nhim out of the team, making the next dog, Sol-leks, fast to the sled.\\r\\nHis intention was to rest Dave, letting him run free behind the sled.\\r\\nSick as he was, Dave resented being taken out, grunting and growling\\r\\nwhile the traces were unfastened, and whimpering broken-heartedly when\\r\\nhe saw Sol-leks in the position he had held and served so long. For the\\r\\npride of trace and trail was his, and, sick unto death, he could not\\r\\nbear that another dog should do his work.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the sled started, he floundered in the soft snow alongside the\\r\\nbeaten trail, attacking Sol-leks with his teeth, rushing against him\\r\\nand trying to thrust him off into the soft snow on the other side,\\r\\nstriving to leap inside his traces and get between him and the sled,\\r\\nand all the while whining and yelping and crying with grief and pain.\\r\\nThe half-breed tried to drive him away with the whip; but he paid no\\r\\nheed to the stinging lash, and the man had not the heart to strike\\r\\nharder. Dave refused to run quietly on the trail behind the sled, where\\r\\nthe going was easy, but continued to flounder alongside in the soft\\r\\nsnow, where the going was most difficult, till exhausted. Then he fell,\\r\\nand lay where he fell, howling lugubriously as the long train of sleds\\r\\nchurned by.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the last remnant of his strength he managed to stagger along\\r\\nbehind till the train made another stop, when he floundered past the\\r\\nsleds to his own, where he stood alongside Sol-leks. His driver\\r\\nlingered a moment to get a light for his pipe from the man behind. Then\\r\\nhe returned and started his dogs. They swung out on the trail with\\r\\nremarkable lack of exertion, turned their heads uneasily, and stopped\\r\\nin surprise. The driver was surprised, too; the sled had not moved. He\\r\\ncalled his comrades to witness the sight. Dave had bitten through both\\r\\nof Sol-leks’s traces, and was standing directly in front of the sled in\\r\\nhis proper place.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe pleaded with his eyes to remain there. The driver was perplexed. His\\r\\ncomrades talked of how a dog could break its heart through being denied\\r\\nthe work that killed it, and recalled instances they had known, where\\r\\ndogs, too old for the toil, or injured, had died because they were cut\\r\\nout of the traces. Also, they held it a mercy, since Dave was to die\\r\\nanyway, that he should die in the traces, heart-easy and content. So he\\r\\nwas harnessed in again, and proudly he pulled as of old, though more\\r\\nthan once he cried out involuntarily from the bite of his inward hurt.\\r\\nSeveral times he fell down and was dragged in the traces, and once the\\r\\nsled ran upon him so that he limped thereafter in one of his hind legs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he held out till camp was reached, when his driver made a place for\\r\\nhim by the fire. Morning found him too weak to travel. At harness-up\\r\\ntime he tried to crawl to his driver. By convulsive efforts he got on\\r\\nhis feet, staggered, and fell. Then he wormed his way forward slowly\\r\\ntoward where the harnesses were being put on his mates. He would\\r\\nadvance his fore legs and drag up his body with a sort of hitching\\r\\nmovement, when he would advance his fore legs and hitch ahead again for\\r\\na few more inches. His strength left him, and the last his mates saw of\\r\\nhim he lay gasping in the snow and yearning toward them. But they could\\r\\nhear him mournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a belt\\r\\nof river timber.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the train was halted. The Scotch half-breed slowly retraced his\\r\\nsteps to the camp they had left. The men ceased talking. A\\r\\nrevolver-shot rang out. The man came back hurriedly. The whips snapped,\\r\\nthe bells tinkled merrily, the sleds churned along the trail; but Buck\\r\\nknew, and every dog knew, what had taken place behind the belt of river\\r\\ntrees.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter V. The Toil of Trace and Trail\\r\\n\\r\\nThirty days from the time it left Dawson, the Salt Water Mail, with\\r\\nBuck and his mates at the fore, arrived at Skaguay. They were in a\\r\\nwretched state, worn out and worn down. Buck’s one hundred and forty\\r\\npounds had dwindled to one hundred and fifteen. The rest of his mates,\\r\\nthough lighter dogs, had relatively lost more weight than he. Pike, the\\r\\nmalingerer, who, in his lifetime of deceit, had often successfully\\r\\nfeigned a hurt leg, was now limping in earnest. Sol-leks was limping,\\r\\nand Dub was suffering from a wrenched shoulder-blade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were all terribly footsore. No spring or rebound was left in them.\\r\\nTheir feet fell heavily on the trail, jarring their bodies and doubling\\r\\nthe fatigue of a day’s travel. There was nothing the matter with them\\r\\nexcept that they were dead tired. It was not the dead-tiredness that\\r\\ncomes through brief and excessive effort, from which recovery is a\\r\\nmatter of hours; but it was the dead-tiredness that comes through the\\r\\nslow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil. There was no\\r\\npower of recuperation left, no reserve strength to call upon. It had\\r\\nbeen all used, the last least bit of it. Every muscle, every fibre,\\r\\nevery cell, was tired, dead tired. And there was reason for it. In less\\r\\nthan five months they had travelled twenty-five hundred miles, during\\r\\nthe last eighteen hundred of which they had had but five days’ rest.\\r\\nWhen they arrived at Skaguay they were apparently on their last legs.\\r\\nThey could barely keep the traces taut, and on the down grades just\\r\\nmanaged to keep out of the way of the sled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mush on, poor sore feets,” the driver encouraged them as they tottered\\r\\ndown the main street of Skaguay. “Dis is de las’. Den we get one long\\r\\nres’. Eh? For sure. One bully long res’.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe drivers confidently expected a long stopover. Themselves, they had\\r\\ncovered twelve hundred miles with two days’ rest, and in the nature of\\r\\nreason and common justice they deserved an interval of loafing. But so\\r\\nmany were the men who had rushed into the Klondike, and so many were\\r\\nthe sweethearts, wives, and kin that had not rushed in, that the\\r\\ncongested mail was taking on Alpine proportions; also, there were\\r\\nofficial orders. Fresh batches of Hudson Bay dogs were to take the\\r\\nplaces of those worthless for the trail. The worthless ones were to be\\r\\ngot rid of, and, since dogs count for little against dollars, they were\\r\\nto be sold.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree days passed, by which time Buck and his mates found how really\\r\\ntired and weak they were. Then, on the morning of the fourth day, two\\r\\nmen from the States came along and bought them, harness and all, for a\\r\\nsong. The men addressed each other as “Hal” and “Charles.” Charles was\\r\\na middle-aged, lightish-colored man, with weak and watery eyes and a\\r\\nmustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up, giving the lie to the\\r\\nlimply drooping lip it concealed. Hal was a youngster of nineteen or\\r\\ntwenty, with a big Colt’s revolver and a hunting-knife strapped about\\r\\nhim on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges. This belt was the\\r\\nmost salient thing about him. It advertised his callowness—a callowness\\r\\nsheer and unutterable. Both men were manifestly out of place, and why\\r\\nsuch as they should adventure the North is part of the mystery of\\r\\nthings that passes understanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck heard the chaffering, saw the money pass between the man and the\\r\\nGovernment agent, and knew that the Scotch half-breed and the\\r\\nmail-train drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of\\r\\nPerrault and François and the others who had gone before. When driven\\r\\nwith his mates to the new owners’ camp, Buck saw a slipshod and\\r\\nslovenly affair, tent half stretched, dishes unwashed, everything in\\r\\ndisorder; also, he saw a woman. “Mercedes” the men called her. She was\\r\\nCharles’s wife and Hal’s sister—a nice family party.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the\\r\\ntent and load the sled. There was a great deal of effort about their\\r\\nmanner, but no businesslike method. The tent was rolled into an awkward\\r\\nbundle three times as large as it should have been. The tin dishes were\\r\\npacked away unwashed. Mercedes continually fluttered in the way of her\\r\\nmen and kept up an unbroken chattering of remonstrance and advice. When\\r\\nthey put a clothes-sack on the front of the sled, she suggested it\\r\\nshould go on the back; and when they had put it on the back, and\\r\\ncovered it over with a couple of other bundles, she discovered\\r\\noverlooked articles which could abide nowhere else but in that very\\r\\nsack, and they unloaded again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree men from a neighboring tent came out and looked on, grinning and\\r\\nwinking at one another.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ve got a right smart load as it is,” said one of them; “and it’s\\r\\nnot me should tell you your business, but I wouldn’t tote that tent\\r\\nalong if I was you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Undreamed of!” cried Mercedes, throwing up her hands in dainty dismay.\\r\\n“However in the world could I manage without a tent?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s springtime, and you won’t get any more cold weather,” the man\\r\\nreplied.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe shook her head decidedly, and Charles and Hal put the last odds and\\r\\nends on top the mountainous load.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Think it’ll ride?” one of the men asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why shouldn’t it?” Charles demanded rather shortly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, that’s all right, that’s all right,” the man hastened meekly to\\r\\nsay. “I was just a-wonderin’, that is all. It seemed a mite top-heavy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles turned his back and drew the lashings down as well as he could,\\r\\nwhich was not in the least well.\\r\\n\\r\\n“An’ of course the dogs can hike along all day with that contraption\\r\\nbehind them,” affirmed a second of the men.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly,” said Hal, with freezing politeness, taking hold of the\\r\\ngee-pole with one hand and swinging his whip from the other. “Mush!” he\\r\\nshouted. “Mush on there!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dogs sprang against the breast-bands, strained hard for a few\\r\\nmoments, then relaxed. They were unable to move the sled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The lazy brutes, I’ll show them,” he cried, preparing to lash out at\\r\\nthem with the whip.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Mercedes interfered, crying, “Oh, Hal, you mustn’t,” as she caught\\r\\nhold of the whip and wrenched it from him. “The poor dears! Now you\\r\\nmust promise you won’t be harsh with them for the rest of the trip, or\\r\\nI won’t go a step.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Precious lot you know about dogs,” her brother sneered; “and I wish\\r\\nyou’d leave me alone. They’re lazy, I tell you, and you’ve got to whip\\r\\nthem to get anything out of them. That’s their way. You ask any one.\\r\\nAsk one of those men.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMercedes looked at them imploringly, untold repugnance at sight of pain\\r\\nwritten in her pretty face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They’re weak as water, if you want to know,” came the reply from one\\r\\nof the men. “Plum tuckered out, that’s what’s the matter. They need a\\r\\nrest.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Rest be blanked,” said Hal, with his beardless lips; and Mercedes\\r\\nsaid, “Oh!” in pain and sorrow at the oath.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she was a clannish creature, and rushed at once to the defence of\\r\\nher brother. “Never mind that man,” she said pointedly. “You’re driving\\r\\nour dogs, and you do what you think best with them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain Hal’s whip fell upon the dogs. They threw themselves against the\\r\\nbreast-bands, dug their feet into the packed snow, got down low to it,\\r\\nand put forth all their strength. The sled held as though it were an\\r\\nanchor. After two efforts, they stood still, panting. The whip was\\r\\nwhistling savagely, when once more Mercedes interfered. She dropped on\\r\\nher knees before Buck, with tears in her eyes, and put her arms around\\r\\nhis neck.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You poor, poor dears,” she cried sympathetically, “why don’t you pull\\r\\nhard?—then you wouldn’t be whipped.” Buck did not like her, but he was\\r\\nfeeling too miserable to resist her, taking it as part of the day’s\\r\\nmiserable work.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the onlookers, who had been clenching his teeth to suppress hot\\r\\nspeech, now spoke up:—\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not that I care a whoop what becomes of you, but for the dogs’\\r\\nsakes I just want to tell you, you can help them a mighty lot by\\r\\nbreaking out that sled. The runners are froze fast. Throw your weight\\r\\nagainst the gee-pole, right and left, and break it out.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA third time the attempt was made, but this time, following the advice,\\r\\nHal broke out the runners which had been frozen to the snow. The\\r\\noverloaded and unwieldy sled forged ahead, Buck and his mates\\r\\nstruggling frantically under the rain of blows. A hundred yards ahead\\r\\nthe path turned and sloped steeply into the main street. It would have\\r\\nrequired an experienced man to keep the top-heavy sled upright, and Hal\\r\\nwas not such a man. As they swung on the turn the sled went over,\\r\\nspilling half its load through the loose lashings. The dogs never\\r\\nstopped. The lightened sled bounded on its side behind them. They were\\r\\nangry because of the ill treatment they had received and the unjust\\r\\nload. Buck was raging. He broke into a run, the team following his\\r\\nlead. Hal cried “Whoa! whoa!” but they gave no heed. He tripped and was\\r\\npulled off his feet. The capsized sled ground over him, and the dogs\\r\\ndashed on up the street, adding to the gayety of Skaguay as they\\r\\nscattered the remainder of the outfit along its chief thoroughfare.\\r\\n\\r\\nKind-hearted citizens caught the dogs and gathered up the scattered\\r\\nbelongings. Also, they gave advice. Half the load and twice the dogs,\\r\\nif they ever expected to reach Dawson, was what was said. Hal and his\\r\\nsister and brother-in-law listened unwillingly, pitched tent, and\\r\\noverhauled the outfit. Canned goods were turned out that made men\\r\\nlaugh, for canned goods on the Long Trail is a thing to dream about.\\r\\n“Blankets for a hotel” quoth one of the men who laughed and helped.\\r\\n“Half as many is too much; get rid of them. Throw away that tent, and\\r\\nall those dishes,—who’s going to wash them, anyway? Good Lord, do you\\r\\nthink you’re travelling on a Pullman?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so it went, the inexorable elimination of the superfluous. Mercedes\\r\\ncried when her clothes-bags were dumped on the ground and article after\\r\\narticle was thrown out. She cried in general, and she cried in\\r\\nparticular over each discarded thing. She clasped hands about knees,\\r\\nrocking back and forth broken-heartedly. She averred she would not go\\r\\nan inch, not for a dozen Charleses. She appealed to everybody and to\\r\\neverything, finally wiping her eyes and proceeding to cast out even\\r\\narticles of apparel that were imperative necessaries. And in her zeal,\\r\\nwhen she had finished with her own, she attacked the belongings of her\\r\\nmen and went through them like a tornado.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis accomplished, the outfit, though cut in half, was still a\\r\\nformidable bulk. Charles and Hal went out in the evening and bought six\\r\\nOutside dogs. These, added to the six of the original team, and Teek\\r\\nand Koona, the huskies obtained at the Rink Rapids on the record trip,\\r\\nbrought the team up to fourteen. But the Outside dogs, though\\r\\npractically broken in since their landing, did not amount to much.\\r\\nThree were short-haired pointers, one was a Newfoundland, and the other\\r\\ntwo were mongrels of indeterminate breed. They did not seem to know\\r\\nanything, these newcomers. Buck and his comrades looked upon them with\\r\\ndisgust, and though he speedily taught them their places and what not\\r\\nto do, he could not teach them what to do. They did not take kindly to\\r\\ntrace and trail. With the exception of the two mongrels, they were\\r\\nbewildered and spirit-broken by the strange savage environment in which\\r\\nthey found themselves and by the ill treatment they had received. The\\r\\ntwo mongrels were without spirit at all; bones were the only things\\r\\nbreakable about them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the newcomers hopeless and forlorn, and the old team worn out by\\r\\ntwenty-five hundred miles of continuous trail, the outlook was anything\\r\\nbut bright. The two men, however, were quite cheerful. And they were\\r\\nproud, too. They were doing the thing in style, with fourteen dogs.\\r\\nThey had seen other sleds depart over the Pass for Dawson, or come in\\r\\nfrom Dawson, but never had they seen a sled with so many as fourteen\\r\\ndogs. In the nature of Arctic travel there was a reason why fourteen\\r\\ndogs should not drag one sled, and that was that one sled could not\\r\\ncarry the food for fourteen dogs. But Charles and Hal did not know\\r\\nthis. They had worked the trip out with a pencil, so much to a dog, so\\r\\nmany dogs, so many days, Q.E.D. Mercedes looked over their shoulders\\r\\nand nodded comprehensively, it was all so very simple.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate next morning Buck led the long team up the street. There was\\r\\nnothing lively about it, no snap or go in him and his fellows. They\\r\\nwere starting dead weary. Four times he had covered the distance\\r\\nbetween Salt Water and Dawson, and the knowledge that, jaded and tired,\\r\\nhe was facing the same trail once more, made him bitter. His heart was\\r\\nnot in the work, nor was the heart of any dog. The Outsides were timid\\r\\nand frightened, the Insides without confidence in their masters.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and\\r\\nthe woman. They did not know how to do anything, and as the days went\\r\\nby it became apparent that they could not learn. They were slack in all\\r\\nthings, without order or discipline. It took them half the night to\\r\\npitch a slovenly camp, and half the morning to break that camp and get\\r\\nthe sled loaded in fashion so slovenly that for the rest of the day\\r\\nthey were occupied in stopping and rearranging the load. Some days they\\r\\ndid not make ten miles. On other days they were unable to get started\\r\\nat all. And on no day did they succeed in making more than half the\\r\\ndistance used by the men as a basis in their dog-food computation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was inevitable that they should go short on dog-food. But they\\r\\nhastened it by overfeeding, bringing the day nearer when underfeeding\\r\\nwould commence. The Outside dogs, whose digestions had not been trained\\r\\nby chronic famine to make the most of little, had voracious appetites.\\r\\nAnd when, in addition to this, the worn-out huskies pulled weakly, Hal\\r\\ndecided that the orthodox ration was too small. He doubled it. And to\\r\\ncap it all, when Mercedes, with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver\\r\\nin her throat, could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more,\\r\\nshe stole from the fish-sacks and fed them slyly. But it was not food\\r\\nthat Buck and the huskies needed, but rest. And though they were making\\r\\npoor time, the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen came the underfeeding. Hal awoke one day to the fact that his\\r\\ndog-food was half gone and the distance only quarter covered; further,\\r\\nthat for love or money no additional dog-food was to be obtained. So he\\r\\ncut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the day’s\\r\\ntravel. His sister and brother-in-law seconded him; but they were\\r\\nfrustrated by their heavy outfit and their own incompetence. It was a\\r\\nsimple matter to give the dogs less food; but it was impossible to make\\r\\nthe dogs travel faster, while their own inability to get under way\\r\\nearlier in the morning prevented them from travelling longer hours. Not\\r\\nonly did they not know how to work dogs, but they did not know how to\\r\\nwork themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first to go was Dub. Poor blundering thief that he was, always\\r\\ngetting caught and punished, he had none the less been a faithful\\r\\nworker. His wrenched shoulder-blade, untreated and unrested, went from\\r\\nbad to worse, till finally Hal shot him with the big Colt’s revolver.\\r\\nIt is a saying of the country that an Outside dog starves to death on\\r\\nthe ration of the husky, so the six Outside dogs under Buck could do no\\r\\nless than die on half the ration of the husky. The Newfoundland went\\r\\nfirst, followed by the three short-haired pointers, the two mongrels\\r\\nhanging more grittily on to life, but going in the end.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time all the amenities and gentlenesses of the Southland had\\r\\nfallen away from the three people. Shorn of its glamour and romance,\\r\\nArctic travel became to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and\\r\\nwomanhood. Mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs, being too occupied\\r\\nwith weeping over herself and with quarrelling with her husband and\\r\\nbrother. To quarrel was the one thing they were never too weary to do.\\r\\nTheir irritability arose out of their misery, increased with it,\\r\\ndoubled upon it, outdistanced it. The wonderful patience of the trail\\r\\nwhich comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore, and remain sweet of\\r\\nspeech and kindly, did not come to these two men and the woman. They\\r\\nhad no inkling of such a patience. They were stiff and in pain; their\\r\\nmuscles ached, their bones ached, their very hearts ached; and because\\r\\nof this they became sharp of speech, and hard words were first on their\\r\\nlips in the morning and last at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles and Hal wrangled whenever Mercedes gave them a chance. It was\\r\\nthe cherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the\\r\\nwork, and neither forbore to speak this belief at every opportunity.\\r\\nSometimes Mercedes sided with her husband, sometimes with her brother.\\r\\nThe result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel. Starting from a\\r\\ndispute as to which should chop a few sticks for the fire (a dispute\\r\\nwhich concerned only Charles and Hal), presently would be lugged in the\\r\\nrest of the family, fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins, people thousands\\r\\nof miles away, and some of them dead. That Hal’s views on art, or the\\r\\nsort of society plays his mother’s brother wrote, should have anything\\r\\nto do with the chopping of a few sticks of firewood, passes\\r\\ncomprehension; nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend in that\\r\\ndirection as in the direction of Charles’s political prejudices. And\\r\\nthat Charles’s sister’s tale-bearing tongue should be relevant to the\\r\\nbuilding of a Yukon fire, was apparent only to Mercedes, who\\r\\ndisburdened herself of copious opinions upon that topic, and\\r\\nincidentally upon a few other traits unpleasantly peculiar to her\\r\\nhusband’s family. In the meantime the fire remained unbuilt, the camp\\r\\nhalf pitched, and the dogs unfed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMercedes nursed a special grievance—the grievance of sex. She was\\r\\npretty and soft, and had been chivalrously treated all her days. But\\r\\nthe present treatment by her husband and brother was everything save\\r\\nchivalrous. It was her custom to be helpless. They complained. Upon\\r\\nwhich impeachment of what to her was her most essential\\r\\nsex-prerogative, she made their lives unendurable. She no longer\\r\\nconsidered the dogs, and because she was sore and tired, she persisted\\r\\nin riding on the sled. She was pretty and soft, but she weighed one\\r\\nhundred and twenty pounds—a lusty last straw to the load dragged by the\\r\\nweak and starving animals. She rode for days, till they fell in the\\r\\ntraces and the sled stood still. Charles and Hal begged her to get off\\r\\nand walk, pleaded with her, entreated, the while she wept and\\r\\nimportuned Heaven with a recital of their brutality.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn one occasion they took her off the sled by main strength. They never\\r\\ndid it again. She let her legs go limp like a spoiled child, and sat\\r\\ndown on the trail. They went on their way, but she did not move. After\\r\\nthey had travelled three miles they unloaded the sled, came back for\\r\\nher, and by main strength put her on the sled again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the excess of their own misery they were callous to the suffering of\\r\\ntheir animals. Hal’s theory, which he practised on others, was that one\\r\\nmust get hardened. He had started out preaching it to his sister and\\r\\nbrother-in-law. Failing there, he hammered it into the dogs with a\\r\\nclub. At the Five Fingers the dog-food gave out, and a toothless old\\r\\nsquaw offered to trade them a few pounds of frozen horse-hide for the\\r\\nColt’s revolver that kept the big hunting-knife company at Hal’s hip. A\\r\\npoor substitute for food was this hide, just as it had been stripped\\r\\nfrom the starved horses of the cattlemen six months back. In its frozen\\r\\nstate it was more like strips of galvanized iron, and when a dog\\r\\nwrestled it into his stomach it thawed into thin and innutritious\\r\\nleathery strings and into a mass of short hair, irritating and\\r\\nindigestible.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd through it all Buck staggered along at the head of the team as in a\\r\\nnightmare. He pulled when he could; when he could no longer pull, he\\r\\nfell down and remained down till blows from whip or club drove him to\\r\\nhis feet again. All the stiffness and gloss had gone out of his\\r\\nbeautiful furry coat. The hair hung down, limp and draggled, or matted\\r\\nwith dried blood where Hal’s club had bruised him. His muscles had\\r\\nwasted away to knotty strings, and the flesh pads had disappeared, so\\r\\nthat each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly through\\r\\nthe loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness. It was\\r\\nheartbreaking, only Buck’s heart was unbreakable. The man in the red\\r\\nsweater had proved that.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it was with Buck, so was it with his mates. They were perambulating\\r\\nskeletons. There were seven all together, including him. In their very\\r\\ngreat misery they had become insensible to the bite of the lash or the\\r\\nbruise of the club. The pain of the beating was dull and distant, just\\r\\nas the things their eyes saw and their ears heard seemed dull and\\r\\ndistant. They were not half living, or quarter living. They were simply\\r\\nso many bags of bones in which sparks of life fluttered faintly. When a\\r\\nhalt was made, they dropped down in the traces like dead dogs, and the\\r\\nspark dimmed and paled and seemed to go out. And when the club or whip\\r\\nfell upon them, the spark fluttered feebly up, and they tottered to\\r\\ntheir feet and staggered on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere came a day when Billee, the good-natured, fell and could not\\r\\nrise. Hal had traded off his revolver, so he took the axe and knocked\\r\\nBillee on the head as he lay in the traces, then cut the carcass out of\\r\\nthe harness and dragged it to one side. Buck saw, and his mates saw,\\r\\nand they knew that this thing was very close to them. On the next day\\r\\nKoona went, and but five of them remained: Joe, too far gone to be\\r\\nmalignant; Pike, crippled and limping, only half conscious and not\\r\\nconscious enough longer to malinger; Sol-leks, the one-eyed, still\\r\\nfaithful to the toil of trace and trail, and mournful in that he had so\\r\\nlittle strength with which to pull; Teek, who had not travelled so far\\r\\nthat winter and who was now beaten more than the others because he was\\r\\nfresher; and Buck, still at the head of the team, but no longer\\r\\nenforcing discipline or striving to enforce it, blind with weakness\\r\\nhalf the time and keeping the trail by the loom of it and by the dim\\r\\nfeel of his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was beautiful spring weather, but neither dogs nor humans were aware\\r\\nof it. Each day the sun rose earlier and set later. It was dawn by\\r\\nthree in the morning, and twilight lingered till nine at night. The\\r\\nwhole long day was a blaze of sunshine. The ghostly winter silence had\\r\\ngiven way to the great spring murmur of awakening life. This murmur\\r\\narose from all the land, fraught with the joy of living. It came from\\r\\nthe things that lived and moved again, things which had been as dead\\r\\nand which had not moved during the long months of frost. The sap was\\r\\nrising in the pines. The willows and aspens were bursting out in young\\r\\nbuds. Shrubs and vines were putting on fresh garbs of green. Crickets\\r\\nsang in the nights, and in the days all manner of creeping, crawling\\r\\nthings rustled forth into the sun. Partridges and woodpeckers were\\r\\nbooming and knocking in the forest. Squirrels were chattering, birds\\r\\nsinging, and overhead honked the wild-fowl driving up from the south in\\r\\ncunning wedges that split the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom every hill slope came the trickle of running water, the music of\\r\\nunseen fountains. All things were thawing, bending, snapping. The Yukon\\r\\nwas straining to break loose the ice that bound it down. It ate away\\r\\nfrom beneath; the sun ate from above. Air-holes formed, fissures sprang\\r\\nand spread apart, while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into\\r\\nthe river. And amid all this bursting, rending, throbbing of awakening\\r\\nlife, under the blazing sun and through the soft-sighing breezes, like\\r\\nwayfarers to death, staggered the two men, the woman, and the huskies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the dogs falling, Mercedes weeping and riding, Hal swearing\\r\\ninnocuously, and Charles’s eyes wistfully watering, they staggered into\\r\\nJohn Thornton’s camp at the mouth of White River. When they halted, the\\r\\ndogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead. Mercedes\\r\\ndried her eyes and looked at John Thornton. Charles sat down on a log\\r\\nto rest. He sat down very slowly and painstakingly what of his great\\r\\nstiffness. Hal did the talking. John Thornton was whittling the last\\r\\ntouches on an axe-handle he had made from a stick of birch. He whittled\\r\\nand listened, gave monosyllabic replies, and, when it was asked, terse\\r\\nadvice. He knew the breed, and he gave his advice in the certainty that\\r\\nit would not be followed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They told us up above that the bottom was dropping out of the trail\\r\\nand that the best thing for us to do was to lay over,” Hal said in\\r\\nresponse to Thornton’s warning to take no more chances on the rotten\\r\\nice. “They told us we couldn’t make White River, and here we are.” This\\r\\nlast with a sneering ring of triumph in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And they told you true,” John Thornton answered. “The bottom’s likely\\r\\nto drop out at any moment. Only fools, with the blind luck of fools,\\r\\ncould have made it. I tell you straight, I wouldn’t risk my carcass on\\r\\nthat ice for all the gold in Alaska.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s because you’re not a fool, I suppose,” said Hal. “All the same,\\r\\nwe’ll go on to Dawson.” He uncoiled his whip. “Get up there, Buck! Hi!\\r\\nGet up there! Mush on!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThornton went on whittling. It was idle, he knew, to get between a fool\\r\\nand his folly; while two or three fools more or less would not alter\\r\\nthe scheme of things.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the team did not get up at the command. It had long since passed\\r\\ninto the stage where blows were required to rouse it. The whip flashed\\r\\nout, here and there, on its merciless errands. John Thornton compressed\\r\\nhis lips. Sol-leks was the first to crawl to his feet. Teek followed.\\r\\nJoe came next, yelping with pain. Pike made painful efforts. Twice he\\r\\nfell over, when half up, and on the third attempt managed to rise. Buck\\r\\nmade no effort. He lay quietly where he had fallen. The lash bit into\\r\\nhim again and again, but he neither whined nor struggled. Several times\\r\\nThornton started, as though to speak, but changed his mind. A moisture\\r\\ncame into his eyes, and, as the whipping continued, he arose and walked\\r\\nirresolutely up and down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the first time Buck had failed, in itself a sufficient reason\\r\\nto drive Hal into a rage. He exchanged the whip for the customary club.\\r\\nBuck refused to move under the rain of heavier blows which now fell\\r\\nupon him. Like his mates, he was barely able to get up, but, unlike\\r\\nthem, he had made up his mind not to get up. He had a vague feeling of\\r\\nimpending doom. This had been strong upon him when he pulled in to the\\r\\nbank, and it had not departed from him. What of the thin and rotten ice\\r\\nhe had felt under his feet all day, it seemed that he sensed disaster\\r\\nclose at hand, out there ahead on the ice where his master was trying\\r\\nto drive him. He refused to stir. So greatly had he suffered, and so\\r\\nfar gone was he, that the blows did not hurt much. And as they\\r\\ncontinued to fall upon him, the spark of life within flickered and went\\r\\ndown. It was nearly out. He felt strangely numb. As though from a great\\r\\ndistance, he was aware that he was being beaten. The last sensations of\\r\\npain left him. He no longer felt anything, though very faintly he could\\r\\nhear the impact of the club upon his body. But it was no longer his\\r\\nbody, it seemed so far away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then, suddenly, without warning, uttering a cry that was\\r\\ninarticulate and more like the cry of an animal, John Thornton sprang\\r\\nupon the man who wielded the club. Hal was hurled backward, as though\\r\\nstruck by a falling tree. Mercedes screamed. Charles looked on\\r\\nwistfully, wiped his watery eyes, but did not get up because of his\\r\\nstiffness.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Thornton stood over Buck, struggling to control himself, too\\r\\nconvulsed with rage to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you strike that dog again, I’ll kill you,” he at last managed to\\r\\nsay in a choking voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s my dog,” Hal replied, wiping the blood from his mouth as he came\\r\\nback. “Get out of my way, or I’ll fix you. I’m going to Dawson.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThornton stood between him and Buck, and evinced no intention of\\r\\ngetting out of the way. Hal drew his long hunting-knife. Mercedes\\r\\nscreamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of\\r\\nhysteria. Thornton rapped Hal’s knuckles with the axe-handle, knocking\\r\\nthe knife to the ground. He rapped his knuckles again as he tried to\\r\\npick it up. Then he stooped, picked it up himself, and with two strokes\\r\\ncut Buck’s traces.\\r\\n\\r\\nHal had no fight left in him. Besides, his hands were full with his\\r\\nsister, or his arms, rather; while Buck was too near dead to be of\\r\\nfurther use in hauling the sled. A few minutes later they pulled out\\r\\nfrom the bank and down the river. Buck heard them go and raised his\\r\\nhead to see, Pike was leading, Sol-leks was at the wheel, and between\\r\\nwere Joe and Teek. They were limping and staggering. Mercedes was\\r\\nriding the loaded sled. Hal guided at the gee-pole, and Charles\\r\\nstumbled along in the rear.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Buck watched them, Thornton knelt beside him and with rough, kindly\\r\\nhands searched for broken bones. By the time his search had disclosed\\r\\nnothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation, the\\r\\nsled was a quarter of a mile away. Dog and man watched it crawling\\r\\nalong over the ice. Suddenly, they saw its back end drop down, as into\\r\\na rut, and the gee-pole, with Hal clinging to it, jerk into the air.\\r\\nMercedes’s scream came to their ears. They saw Charles turn and make\\r\\none step to run back, and then a whole section of ice give way and dogs\\r\\nand humans disappear. A yawning hole was all that was to be seen. The\\r\\nbottom had dropped out of the trail.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Thornton and Buck looked at each other.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You poor devil,” said John Thornton, and Buck licked his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter VI. For the Love of a Man\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen John Thornton froze his feet in the previous December his partners\\r\\nhad made him comfortable and left him to get well, going on themselves\\r\\nup the river to get out a raft of saw-logs for Dawson. He was still\\r\\nlimping slightly at the time he rescued Buck, but with the continued\\r\\nwarm weather even the slight limp left him. And here, lying by the\\r\\nriver bank through the long spring days, watching the running water,\\r\\nlistening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature, Buck\\r\\nslowly won back his strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nA rest comes very good after one has travelled three thousand miles,\\r\\nand it must be confessed that Buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed, his\\r\\nmuscles swelled out, and the flesh came back to cover his bones. For\\r\\nthat matter, they were all loafing,—Buck, John Thornton, and Skeet and\\r\\nNig,—waiting for the raft to come that was to carry them down to\\r\\nDawson. Skeet was a little Irish setter who early made friends with\\r\\nBuck, who, in a dying condition, was unable to resent her first\\r\\nadvances. She had the doctor trait which some dogs possess; and as a\\r\\nmother cat washes her kittens, so she washed and cleansed Buck’s\\r\\nwounds. Regularly, each morning after he had finished his breakfast,\\r\\nshe performed her self-appointed task, till he came to look for her\\r\\nministrations as much as he did for Thornton’s. Nig, equally friendly,\\r\\nthough less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and\\r\\nhalf deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Buck’s surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him. They\\r\\nseemed to share the kindliness and largeness of John Thornton. As Buck\\r\\ngrew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games, in\\r\\nwhich Thornton himself could not forbear to join; and in this fashion\\r\\nBuck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence. Love,\\r\\ngenuine passionate love, was his for the first time. This he had never\\r\\nexperienced at Judge Miller’s down in the sun-kissed Santa Clara\\r\\nValley. With the Judge’s sons, hunting and tramping, it had been a\\r\\nworking partnership; with the Judge’s grandsons, a sort of pompous\\r\\nguardianship; and with the Judge himself, a stately and dignified\\r\\nfriendship. But love that was feverish and burning, that was adoration,\\r\\nthat was madness, it had taken John Thornton to arouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis man had saved his life, which was something; but, further, he was\\r\\nthe ideal master. Other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a\\r\\nsense of duty and business expediency; he saw to the welfare of his as\\r\\nif they were his own children, because he could not help it. And he saw\\r\\nfurther. He never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word, and to\\r\\nsit down for a long talk with them (“gas” he called it) was as much his\\r\\ndelight as theirs. He had a way of taking Buck’s head roughly between\\r\\nhis hands, and resting his own head upon Buck’s, of shaking him back\\r\\nand forth, the while calling him ill names that to Buck were love\\r\\nnames. Buck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound\\r\\nof murmured oaths, and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his\\r\\nheart would be shaken out of his body so great was its ecstasy. And\\r\\nwhen, released, he sprang to his feet, his mouth laughing, his eyes\\r\\neloquent, his throat vibrant with unuttered sound, and in that fashion\\r\\nremained without movement, John Thornton would reverently exclaim,\\r\\n“God! you can all but speak!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt. He would\\r\\noften seize Thornton’s hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the\\r\\nflesh bore the impress of his teeth for some time afterward. And as\\r\\nBuck understood the oaths to be love words, so the man understood this\\r\\nfeigned bite for a caress.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the most part, however, Buck’s love was expressed in adoration.\\r\\nWhile he went wild with happiness when Thornton touched him or spoke to\\r\\nhim, he did not seek these tokens. Unlike Skeet, who was wont to shove\\r\\nher nose under Thornton’s hand and nudge and nudge till petted, or Nig,\\r\\nwho would stalk up and rest his great head on Thornton’s knee, Buck was\\r\\ncontent to adore at a distance. He would lie by the hour, eager, alert,\\r\\nat Thornton’s feet, looking up into his face, dwelling upon it,\\r\\nstudying it, following with keenest interest each fleeting expression,\\r\\nevery movement or change of feature. Or, as chance might have it, he\\r\\nwould lie farther away, to the side or rear, watching the outlines of\\r\\nthe man and the occasional movements of his body. And often, such was\\r\\nthe communion in which they lived, the strength of Buck’s gaze would\\r\\ndraw John Thornton’s head around, and he would return the gaze, without\\r\\nspeech, his heart shining out of his eyes as Buck’s heart shone out.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time after his rescue, Buck did not like Thornton to get out\\r\\nof his sight. From the moment he left the tent to when he entered it\\r\\nagain, Buck would follow at his heels. His transient masters since he\\r\\nhad come into the Northland had bred in him a fear that no master could\\r\\nbe permanent. He was afraid that Thornton would pass out of his life as\\r\\nPerrault and François and the Scotch half-breed had passed out. Even in\\r\\nthe night, in his dreams, he was haunted by this fear. At such times he\\r\\nwould shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of the\\r\\ntent, where he would stand and listen to the sound of his master’s\\r\\nbreathing.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in spite of this great love he bore John Thornton, which seemed to\\r\\nbespeak the soft civilizing influence, the strain of the primitive,\\r\\nwhich the Northland had aroused in him, remained alive and active.\\r\\nFaithfulness and devotion, things born of fire and roof, were his; yet\\r\\nhe retained his wildness and wiliness. He was a thing of the wild, come\\r\\nin from the wild to sit by John Thornton’s fire, rather than a dog of\\r\\nthe soft Southland stamped with the marks of generations of\\r\\ncivilization. Because of his very great love, he could not steal from\\r\\nthis man, but from any other man, in any other camp, he did not\\r\\nhesitate an instant; while the cunning with which he stole enabled him\\r\\nto escape detection.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis face and body were scored by the teeth of many dogs, and he fought\\r\\nas fiercely as ever and more shrewdly. Skeet and Nig were too\\r\\ngood-natured for quarrelling,—besides, they belonged to John Thornton;\\r\\nbut the strange dog, no matter what the breed or valor, swiftly\\r\\nacknowledged Buck’s supremacy or found himself struggling for life with\\r\\na terrible antagonist. And Buck was merciless. He had learned well the\\r\\nlaw of club and fang, and he never forewent an advantage or drew back\\r\\nfrom a foe he had started on the way to Death. He had lessoned from\\r\\nSpitz, and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail, and\\r\\nknew there was no middle course. He must master or be mastered; while\\r\\nto show mercy was a weakness. Mercy did not exist in the primordial\\r\\nlife. It was misunderstood for fear, and such misunderstandings made\\r\\nfor death. Kill or be killed, eat or be eaten, was the law; and this\\r\\nmandate, down out of the depths of Time, he obeyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn. He\\r\\nlinked the past with the present, and the eternity behind him throbbed\\r\\nthrough him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and\\r\\nseasons swayed. He sat by John Thornton’s fire, a broad-breasted dog,\\r\\nwhite-fanged and long-furred; but behind him were the shades of all\\r\\nmanner of dogs, half-wolves and wild wolves, urgent and prompting,\\r\\ntasting the savor of the meat he ate, thirsting for the water he drank,\\r\\nscenting the wind with him, listening with him and telling him the\\r\\nsounds made by the wild life in the forest, dictating his moods,\\r\\ndirecting his actions, lying down to sleep with him when he lay down,\\r\\nand dreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselves the stuff\\r\\nof his dreams.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo peremptorily did these shades beckon him, that each day mankind and\\r\\nthe claims of mankind slipped farther from him. Deep in the forest a\\r\\ncall was sounding, and as often as he heard this call, mysteriously\\r\\nthrilling and luring, he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire\\r\\nand the beaten earth around it, and to plunge into the forest, and on\\r\\nand on, he knew not where or why; nor did he wonder where or why, the\\r\\ncall sounding imperiously, deep in the forest. But as often as he\\r\\ngained the soft unbroken earth and the green shade, the love for John\\r\\nThornton drew him back to the fire again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThornton alone held him. The rest of mankind was as nothing. Chance\\r\\ntravellers might praise or pet him; but he was cold under it all, and\\r\\nfrom a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away. When\\r\\nThornton’s partners, Hans and Pete, arrived on the long-expected raft,\\r\\nBuck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to\\r\\nThornton; after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way,\\r\\naccepting favors from them as though he favored them by accepting. They\\r\\nwere of the same large type as Thornton, living close to the earth,\\r\\nthinking simply and seeing clearly; and ere they swung the raft into\\r\\nthe big eddy by the saw-mill at Dawson, they understood Buck and his\\r\\nways, and did not insist upon an intimacy such as obtained with Skeet\\r\\nand Nig.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Thornton, however, his love seemed to grow and grow. He, alone\\r\\namong men, could put a pack upon Buck’s back in the summer travelling.\\r\\nNothing was too great for Buck to do, when Thornton commanded. One day\\r\\n(they had grub-staked themselves from the proceeds of the raft and left\\r\\nDawson for the head-waters of the Tanana) the men and dogs were sitting\\r\\non the crest of a cliff which fell away, straight down, to naked\\r\\nbed-rock three hundred feet below. John Thornton was sitting near the\\r\\nedge, Buck at his shoulder. A thoughtless whim seized Thornton, and he\\r\\ndrew the attention of Hans and Pete to the experiment he had in mind.\\r\\n“Jump, Buck!” he commanded, sweeping his arm out and over the chasm.\\r\\nThe next instant he was grappling with Buck on the extreme edge, while\\r\\nHans and Pete were dragging them back into safety.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s uncanny,” Pete said, after it was over and they had caught their\\r\\nspeech.\\r\\n\\r\\nThornton shook his head. “No, it is splendid, and it is terrible, too.\\r\\nDo you know, it sometimes makes me afraid.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not hankering to be the man that lays hands on you while he’s\\r\\naround,” Pete announced conclusively, nodding his head toward Buck.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Py Jingo!” was Hans’s contribution. “Not mineself either.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was at Circle City, ere the year was out, that Pete’s apprehensions\\r\\nwere realized. “Black” Burton, a man evil-tempered and malicious, had\\r\\nbeen picking a quarrel with a tenderfoot at the bar, when Thornton\\r\\nstepped good-naturedly between. Buck, as was his custom, was lying in a\\r\\ncorner, head on paws, watching his master’s every action. Burton struck\\r\\nout, without warning, straight from the shoulder. Thornton was sent\\r\\nspinning, and saved himself from falling only by clutching the rail of\\r\\nthe bar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who were looking on heard what was neither bark nor yelp, but a\\r\\nsomething which is best described as a roar, and they saw Buck’s body\\r\\nrise up in the air as he left the floor for Burton’s throat. The man\\r\\nsaved his life by instinctively throwing out his arm, but was hurled\\r\\nbackward to the floor with Buck on top of him. Buck loosed his teeth\\r\\nfrom the flesh of the arm and drove in again for the throat. This time\\r\\nthe man succeeded only in partly blocking, and his throat was torn\\r\\nopen. Then the crowd was upon Buck, and he was driven off; but while a\\r\\nsurgeon checked the bleeding, he prowled up and down, growling\\r\\nfuriously, attempting to rush in, and being forced back by an array of\\r\\nhostile clubs. A “miners’ meeting,” called on the spot, decided that\\r\\nthe dog had sufficient provocation, and Buck was discharged. But his\\r\\nreputation was made, and from that day his name spread through every\\r\\ncamp in Alaska.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater on, in the fall of the year, he saved John Thornton’s life in\\r\\nquite another fashion. The three partners were lining a long and narrow\\r\\npoling-boat down a bad stretch of rapids on the Forty-Mile Creek. Hans\\r\\nand Pete moved along the bank, snubbing with a thin Manila rope from\\r\\ntree to tree, while Thornton remained in the boat, helping its descent\\r\\nby means of a pole, and shouting directions to the shore. Buck, on the\\r\\nbank, worried and anxious, kept abreast of the boat, his eyes never off\\r\\nhis master.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a particularly bad spot, where a ledge of barely submerged rocks\\r\\njutted out into the river, Hans cast off the rope, and, while Thornton\\r\\npoled the boat out into the stream, ran down the bank with the end in\\r\\nhis hand to snub the boat when it had cleared the ledge. This it did,\\r\\nand was flying down-stream in a current as swift as a mill-race, when\\r\\nHans checked it with the rope and checked too suddenly. The boat\\r\\nflirted over and snubbed in to the bank bottom up, while Thornton,\\r\\nflung sheer out of it, was carried down-stream toward the worst part of\\r\\nthe rapids, a stretch of wild water in which no swimmer could live.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck had sprung in on the instant; and at the end of three hundred\\r\\nyards, amid a mad swirl of water, he overhauled Thornton. When he felt\\r\\nhim grasp his tail, Buck headed for the bank, swimming with all his\\r\\nsplendid strength. But the progress shoreward was slow; the progress\\r\\ndown-stream amazingly rapid. From below came the fatal roaring where\\r\\nthe wild current went wilder and was rent in shreds and spray by the\\r\\nrocks which thrust through like the teeth of an enormous comb. The suck\\r\\nof the water as it took the beginning of the last steep pitch was\\r\\nfrightful, and Thornton knew that the shore was impossible. He scraped\\r\\nfuriously over a rock, bruised across a second, and struck a third with\\r\\ncrushing force. He clutched its slippery top with both hands, releasing\\r\\nBuck, and above the roar of the churning water shouted: “Go, Buck! Go!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck could not hold his own, and swept on down-stream, struggling\\r\\ndesperately, but unable to win back. When he heard Thornton’s command\\r\\nrepeated, he partly reared out of the water, throwing his head high, as\\r\\nthough for a last look, then turned obediently toward the bank. He swam\\r\\npowerfully and was dragged ashore by Pete and Hans at the very point\\r\\nwhere swimming ceased to be possible and destruction began.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey knew that the time a man could cling to a slippery rock in the\\r\\nface of that driving current was a matter of minutes, and they ran as\\r\\nfast as they could up the bank to a point far above where Thornton was\\r\\nhanging on. They attached the line with which they had been snubbing\\r\\nthe boat to Buck’s neck and shoulders, being careful that it should\\r\\nneither strangle him nor impede his swimming, and launched him into the\\r\\nstream. He struck out boldly, but not straight enough into the stream.\\r\\nHe discovered the mistake too late, when Thornton was abreast of him\\r\\nand a bare half-dozen strokes away while he was being carried\\r\\nhelplessly past.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans promptly snubbed with the rope, as though Buck were a boat. The\\r\\nrope thus tightening on him in the sweep of the current, he was jerked\\r\\nunder the surface, and under the surface he remained till his body\\r\\nstruck against the bank and he was hauled out. He was half drowned, and\\r\\nHans and Pete threw themselves upon him, pounding the breath into him\\r\\nand the water out of him. He staggered to his feet and fell down. The\\r\\nfaint sound of Thornton’s voice came to them, and though they could not\\r\\nmake out the words of it, they knew that he was in his extremity. His\\r\\nmaster’s voice acted on Buck like an electric shock, He sprang to his\\r\\nfeet and ran up the bank ahead of the men to the point of his previous\\r\\ndeparture.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the rope was attached and he was launched, and again he struck\\r\\nout, but this time straight into the stream. He had miscalculated once,\\r\\nbut he would not be guilty of it a second time. Hans paid out the rope,\\r\\npermitting no slack, while Pete kept it clear of coils. Buck held on\\r\\ntill he was on a line straight above Thornton; then he turned, and with\\r\\nthe speed of an express train headed down upon him. Thornton saw him\\r\\ncoming, and, as Buck struck him like a battering ram, with the whole\\r\\nforce of the current behind him, he reached up and closed with both\\r\\narms around the shaggy neck. Hans snubbed the rope around the tree, and\\r\\nBuck and Thornton were jerked under the water. Strangling, suffocating,\\r\\nsometimes one uppermost and sometimes the other, dragging over the\\r\\njagged bottom, smashing against rocks and snags, they veered in to the\\r\\nbank.\\r\\n\\r\\nThornton came to, belly downward and being violently propelled back and\\r\\nforth across a drift log by Hans and Pete. His first glance was for\\r\\nBuck, over whose limp and apparently lifeless body Nig was setting up a\\r\\nhowl, while Skeet was licking the wet face and closed eyes. Thornton\\r\\nwas himself bruised and battered, and he went carefully over Buck’s\\r\\nbody, when he had been brought around, finding three broken ribs.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That settles it,” he announced. “We camp right here.” And camp they\\r\\ndid, till Buck’s ribs knitted and he was able to travel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat winter, at Dawson, Buck performed another exploit, not so heroic,\\r\\nperhaps, but one that put his name many notches higher on the\\r\\ntotem-pole of Alaskan fame. This exploit was particularly gratifying to\\r\\nthe three men; for they stood in need of the outfit which it furnished,\\r\\nand were enabled to make a long-desired trip into the virgin East,\\r\\nwhere miners had not yet appeared. It was brought about by a\\r\\nconversation in the Eldorado Saloon, in which men waxed boastful of\\r\\ntheir favorite dogs. Buck, because of his record, was the target for\\r\\nthese men, and Thornton was driven stoutly to defend him. At the end of\\r\\nhalf an hour one man stated that his dog could start a sled with five\\r\\nhundred pounds and walk off with it; a second bragged six hundred for\\r\\nhis dog; and a third, seven hundred.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pooh! pooh!” said John Thornton; “Buck can start a thousand pounds.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And break it out? and walk off with it for a hundred yards?” demanded\\r\\nMatthewson, a Bonanza King, he of the seven hundred vaunt.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And break it out, and walk off with it for a hundred yards,” John\\r\\nThornton said coolly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,” Matthewson said, slowly and deliberately, so that all could\\r\\nhear, “I’ve got a thousand dollars that says he can’t. And there it\\r\\nis.” So saying, he slammed a sack of gold dust of the size of a bologna\\r\\nsausage down upon the bar.\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody spoke. Thornton’s bluff, if bluff it was, had been called. He\\r\\ncould feel a flush of warm blood creeping up his face. His tongue had\\r\\ntricked him. He did not know whether Buck could start a thousand\\r\\npounds. Half a ton! The enormousness of it appalled him. He had great\\r\\nfaith in Buck’s strength and had often thought him capable of starting\\r\\nsuch a load; but never, as now, had he faced the possibility of it, the\\r\\neyes of a dozen men fixed upon him, silent and waiting. Further, he had\\r\\nno thousand dollars; nor had Hans or Pete.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve got a sled standing outside now, with twenty fiftypound sacks of\\r\\nflour on it,” Matthewson went on with brutal directness; “so don’t let\\r\\nthat hinder you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThornton did not reply. He did not know what to say. He glanced from\\r\\nface to face in the absent way of a man who has lost the power of\\r\\nthought and is seeking somewhere to find the thing that will start it\\r\\ngoing again. The face of Jim O’Brien, a Mastodon King and old-time\\r\\ncomrade, caught his eyes. It was as a cue to him, seeming to rouse him\\r\\nto do what he would never have dreamed of doing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can you lend me a thousand?” he asked, almost in a whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sure,” answered O’Brien, thumping down a plethoric sack by the side of\\r\\nMatthewson’s. “Though it’s little faith I’m having, John, that the\\r\\nbeast can do the trick.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test. The\\r\\ntables were deserted, and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth to see\\r\\nthe outcome of the wager and to lay odds. Several hundred men, furred\\r\\nand mittened, banked around the sled within easy distance. Matthewson’s\\r\\nsled, loaded with a thousand pounds of flour, had been standing for a\\r\\ncouple of hours, and in the intense cold (it was sixty below zero) the\\r\\nrunners had frozen fast to the hard-packed snow. Men offered odds of\\r\\ntwo to one that Buck could not budge the sled. A quibble arose\\r\\nconcerning the phrase “break out.” O’Brien contended it was Thornton’s\\r\\nprivilege to knock the runners loose, leaving Buck to “break it out”\\r\\nfrom a dead standstill. Matthewson insisted that the phrase included\\r\\nbreaking the runners from the frozen grip of the snow. A majority of\\r\\nthe men who had witnessed the making of the bet decided in his favor,\\r\\nwhereat the odds went up to three to one against Buck.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no takers. Not a man believed him capable of the feat.\\r\\nThornton had been hurried into the wager, heavy with doubt; and now\\r\\nthat he looked at the sled itself, the concrete fact, with the regular\\r\\nteam of ten dogs curled up in the snow before it, the more impossible\\r\\nthe task appeared. Matthewson waxed jubilant.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Three to one!” he proclaimed. “I’ll lay you another thousand at that\\r\\nfigure, Thornton. What d’ye say?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThornton’s doubt was strong in his face, but his fighting spirit was\\r\\naroused—the fighting spirit that soars above odds, fails to recognize\\r\\nthe impossible, and is deaf to all save the clamor for battle. He\\r\\ncalled Hans and Pete to him. Their sacks were slim, and with his own\\r\\nthe three partners could rake together only two hundred dollars. In the\\r\\nebb of their fortunes, this sum was their total capital; yet they laid\\r\\nit unhesitatingly against Matthewson’s six hundred.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team of ten dogs was unhitched, and Buck, with his own harness, was\\r\\nput into the sled. He had caught the contagion of the excitement, and\\r\\nhe felt that in some way he must do a great thing for John Thornton.\\r\\nMurmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went up. He was in\\r\\nperfect condition, without an ounce of superfluous flesh, and the one\\r\\nhundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many pounds of grit\\r\\nand virility. His furry coat shone with the sheen of silk. Down the\\r\\nneck and across the shoulders, his mane, in repose as it was, half\\r\\nbristled and seemed to lift with every movement, as though excess of\\r\\nvigor made each particular hair alive and active. The great breast and\\r\\nheavy fore legs were no more than in proportion with the rest of the\\r\\nbody, where the muscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin. Men\\r\\nfelt these muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron, and the odds went\\r\\ndown to two to one.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gad, sir! Gad, sir!” stuttered a member of the latest dynasty, a king\\r\\nof the Skookum Benches. “I offer you eight hundred for him, sir, before\\r\\nthe test, sir; eight hundred just as he stands.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThornton shook his head and stepped to Buck’s side.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must stand off from him,” Matthewson protested. “Free play and\\r\\nplenty of room.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crowd fell silent; only could be heard the voices of the gamblers\\r\\nvainly offering two to one. Everybody acknowledged Buck a magnificent\\r\\nanimal, but twenty fifty-pound sacks of flour bulked too large in their\\r\\neyes for them to loosen their pouch-strings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThornton knelt down by Buck’s side. He took his head in his two hands\\r\\nand rested cheek on cheek. He did not playfully shake him, as was his\\r\\nwont, or murmur soft love curses; but he whispered in his ear. “As you\\r\\nlove me, Buck. As you love me,” was what he whispered. Buck whined with\\r\\nsuppressed eagerness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crowd was watching curiously. The affair was growing mysterious. It\\r\\nseemed like a conjuration. As Thornton got to his feet, Buck seized his\\r\\nmittened hand between his jaws, pressing in with his teeth and\\r\\nreleasing slowly, half-reluctantly. It was the answer, in terms, not of\\r\\nspeech, but of love. Thornton stepped well back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, Buck,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck tightened the traces, then slacked them for a matter of several\\r\\ninches. It was the way he had learned.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gee!” Thornton’s voice rang out, sharp in the tense silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck swung to the right, ending the movement in a plunge that took up\\r\\nthe slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty\\r\\npounds. The load quivered, and from under the runners arose a crisp\\r\\ncrackling.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Haw!” Thornton commanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck duplicated the manœuvre, this time to the left. The crackling\\r\\nturned into a snapping, the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and\\r\\ngrating several inches to the side. The sled was broken out. Men were\\r\\nholding their breaths, intensely unconscious of the fact.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, MUSH!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThornton’s command cracked out like a pistol-shot. Buck threw himself\\r\\nforward, tightening the traces with a jarring lunge. His whole body was\\r\\ngathered compactly together in the tremendous effort, the muscles\\r\\nwrithing and knotting like live things under the silky fur. His great\\r\\nchest was low to the ground, his head forward and down, while his feet\\r\\nwere flying like mad, the claws scarring the hard-packed snow in\\r\\nparallel grooves. The sled swayed and trembled, half-started forward.\\r\\nOne of his feet slipped, and one man groaned aloud. Then the sled\\r\\nlurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks, though it\\r\\nnever really came to a dead stop again...half an inch...an inch... two\\r\\ninches... The jerks perceptibly diminished; as the sled gained\\r\\nmomentum, he caught them up, till it was moving steadily along.\\r\\n\\r\\nMen gasped and began to breathe again, unaware that for a moment they\\r\\nhad ceased to breathe. Thornton was running behind, encouraging Buck\\r\\nwith short, cheery words. The distance had been measured off, and as he\\r\\nneared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the hundred yards,\\r\\na cheer began to grow and grow, which burst into a roar as he passed\\r\\nthe firewood and halted at command. Every man was tearing himself\\r\\nloose, even Matthewson. Hats and mittens were flying in the air. Men\\r\\nwere shaking hands, it did not matter with whom, and bubbling over in a\\r\\ngeneral incoherent babel.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Thornton fell on his knees beside Buck. Head was against head, and\\r\\nhe was shaking him back and forth. Those who hurried up heard him\\r\\ncursing Buck, and he cursed him long and fervently, and softly and\\r\\nlovingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gad, sir! Gad, sir!” spluttered the Skookum Bench king. “I’ll give you\\r\\na thousand for him, sir, a thousand, sir—twelve hundred, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThornton rose to his feet. His eyes were wet. The tears were streaming\\r\\nfrankly down his cheeks. “Sir,” he said to the Skookum Bench king, “no,\\r\\nsir. You can go to hell, sir. It’s the best I can do for you, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck seized Thornton’s hand in his teeth. Thornton shook him back and\\r\\nforth. As though animated by a common impulse, the onlookers drew back\\r\\nto a respectful distance; nor were they again indiscreet enough to\\r\\ninterrupt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter VII. The Sounding of the Call\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Buck earned sixteen hundred dollars in five minutes for John\\r\\nThornton, he made it possible for his master to pay off certain debts\\r\\nand to journey with his partners into the East after a fabled lost\\r\\nmine, the history of which was as old as the history of the country.\\r\\nMany men had sought it; few had found it; and more than a few there\\r\\nwere who had never returned from the quest. This lost mine was steeped\\r\\nin tragedy and shrouded in mystery. No one knew of the first man. The\\r\\noldest tradition stopped before it got back to him. From the beginning\\r\\nthere had been an ancient and ramshackle cabin. Dying men had sworn to\\r\\nit, and to the mine the site of which it marked, clinching their\\r\\ntestimony with nuggets that were unlike any known grade of gold in the\\r\\nNorthland.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no living man had looted this treasure house, and the dead were\\r\\ndead; wherefore John Thornton and Pete and Hans, with Buck and half a\\r\\ndozen other dogs, faced into the East on an unknown trail to achieve\\r\\nwhere men and dogs as good as themselves had failed. They sledded\\r\\nseventy miles up the Yukon, swung to the left into the Stewart River,\\r\\npassed the Mayo and the McQuestion, and held on until the Stewart\\r\\nitself became a streamlet, threading the upstanding peaks which marked\\r\\nthe backbone of the continent.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Thornton asked little of man or nature. He was unafraid of the\\r\\nwild. With a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the\\r\\nwilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased.\\r\\nBeing in no haste, Indian fashion, he hunted his dinner in the course\\r\\nof the day’s travel; and if he failed to find it, like the Indian, he\\r\\nkept on travelling, secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he\\r\\nwould come to it. So, on this great journey into the East, straight\\r\\nmeat was the bill of fare, ammunition and tools principally made up the\\r\\nload on the sled, and the time-card was drawn upon the limitless\\r\\nfuture.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Buck it was boundless delight, this hunting, fishing, and indefinite\\r\\nwandering through strange places. For weeks at a time they would hold\\r\\non steadily, day after day; and for weeks upon end they would camp,\\r\\nhere and there, the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through\\r\\nfrozen muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat\\r\\nof the fire. Sometimes they went hungry, sometimes they feasted\\r\\nriotously, all according to the abundance of game and the fortune of\\r\\nhunting. Summer arrived, and dogs and men packed on their backs, rafted\\r\\nacross blue mountain lakes, and descended or ascended unknown rivers in\\r\\nslender boats whipsawed from the standing forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe months came and went, and back and forth they twisted through the\\r\\nuncharted vastness, where no men were and yet where men had been if the\\r\\nLost Cabin were true. They went across divides in summer blizzards,\\r\\nshivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber\\r\\nline and the eternal snows, dropped into summer valleys amid swarming\\r\\ngnats and flies, and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and\\r\\nflowers as ripe and fair as any the Southland could boast. In the fall\\r\\nof the year they penetrated a weird lake country, sad and silent, where\\r\\nwildfowl had been, but where then there was no life nor sign of\\r\\nlife—only the blowing of chill winds, the forming of ice in sheltered\\r\\nplaces, and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of\\r\\nmen who had gone before. Once, they came upon a path blazed through the\\r\\nforest, an ancient path, and the Lost Cabin seemed very near. But the\\r\\npath began nowhere and ended nowhere, and it remained mystery, as the\\r\\nman who made it and the reason he made it remained mystery. Another\\r\\ntime they chanced upon the time-graven wreckage of a hunting lodge, and\\r\\namid the shreds of rotted blankets John Thornton found a long-barrelled\\r\\nflint-lock. He knew it for a Hudson Bay Company gun of the young days\\r\\nin the Northwest, when such a gun was worth its height in beaver skins\\r\\npacked flat, And that was all—no hint as to the man who in an early day\\r\\nhad reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpring came on once more, and at the end of all their wandering they\\r\\nfound, not the Lost Cabin, but a shallow placer in a broad valley where\\r\\nthe gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the\\r\\nwashing-pan. They sought no farther. Each day they worked earned them\\r\\nthousands of dollars in clean dust and nuggets, and they worked every\\r\\nday. The gold was sacked in moose-hide bags, fifty pounds to the bag,\\r\\nand piled like so much firewood outside the spruce-bough lodge. Like\\r\\ngiants they toiled, days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as\\r\\nthey heaped the treasure up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing for the dogs to do, save the hauling in of meat now\\r\\nand again that Thornton killed, and Buck spent long hours musing by the\\r\\nfire. The vision of the short-legged hairy man came to him more\\r\\nfrequently, now that there was little work to be done; and often,\\r\\nblinking by the fire, Buck wandered with him in that other world which\\r\\nhe remembered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe salient thing of this other world seemed fear. When he watched the\\r\\nhairy man sleeping by the fire, head between his knees and hands\\r\\nclasped above, Buck saw that he slept restlessly, with many starts and\\r\\nawakenings, at which times he would peer fearfully into the darkness\\r\\nand fling more wood upon the fire. Did they walk by the beach of a sea,\\r\\nwhere the hairy man gathered shellfish and ate them as he gathered, it\\r\\nwas with eyes that roved everywhere for hidden danger and with legs\\r\\nprepared to run like the wind at its first appearance. Through the\\r\\nforest they crept noiselessly, Buck at the hairy man’s heels; and they\\r\\nwere alert and vigilant, the pair of them, ears twitching and moving\\r\\nand nostrils quivering, for the man heard and smelled as keenly as\\r\\nBuck. The hairy man could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as\\r\\nfast as on the ground, swinging by the arms from limb to limb,\\r\\nsometimes a dozen feet apart, letting go and catching, never falling,\\r\\nnever missing his grip. In fact, he seemed as much at home among the\\r\\ntrees as on the ground; and Buck had memories of nights of vigil spent\\r\\nbeneath trees wherein the hairy man roosted, holding on tightly as he\\r\\nslept.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd closely akin to the visions of the hairy man was the call still\\r\\nsounding in the depths of the forest. It filled him with a great unrest\\r\\nand strange desires. It caused him to feel a vague, sweet gladness, and\\r\\nhe was aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what.\\r\\nSometimes he pursued the call into the forest, looking for it as though\\r\\nit were a tangible thing, barking softly or defiantly, as the mood\\r\\nmight dictate. He would thrust his nose into the cool wood moss, or\\r\\ninto the black soil where long grasses grew, and snort with joy at the\\r\\nfat earth smells; or he would crouch for hours, as if in concealment,\\r\\nbehind fungus-covered trunks of fallen trees, wide-eyed and wide-eared\\r\\nto all that moved and sounded about him. It might be, lying thus, that\\r\\nhe hoped to surprise this call he could not understand. But he did not\\r\\nknow why he did these various things. He was impelled to do them, and\\r\\ndid not reason about them at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIrresistible impulses seized him. He would be lying in camp, dozing\\r\\nlazily in the heat of the day, when suddenly his head would lift and\\r\\nhis ears cock up, intent and listening, and he would spring to his feet\\r\\nand dash away, and on and on, for hours, through the forest aisles and\\r\\nacross the open spaces where the niggerheads bunched. He loved to run\\r\\ndown dry watercourses, and to creep and spy upon the bird life in the\\r\\nwoods. For a day at a time he would lie in the underbrush where he\\r\\ncould watch the partridges drumming and strutting up and down. But\\r\\nespecially he loved to run in the dim twilight of the summer midnights,\\r\\nlistening to the subdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest, reading\\r\\nsigns and sounds as man may read a book, and seeking for the mysterious\\r\\nsomething that called—called, waking or sleeping, at all times, for him\\r\\nto come.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night he sprang from sleep with a start, eager-eyed, nostrils\\r\\nquivering and scenting, his mane bristling in recurrent waves. From the\\r\\nforest came the call (or one note of it, for the call was many noted),\\r\\ndistinct and definite as never before,—a long-drawn howl, like, yet\\r\\nunlike, any noise made by husky dog. And he knew it, in the old\\r\\nfamiliar way, as a sound heard before. He sprang through the sleeping\\r\\ncamp and in swift silence dashed through the woods. As he drew closer\\r\\nto the cry he went more slowly, with caution in every movement, till he\\r\\ncame to an open place among the trees, and looking out saw, erect on\\r\\nhaunches, with nose pointed to the sky, a long, lean, timber wolf.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had made no noise, yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense\\r\\nhis presence. Buck stalked into the open, half crouching, body gathered\\r\\ncompactly together, tail straight and stiff, feet falling with unwonted\\r\\ncare. Every movement advertised commingled threatening and overture of\\r\\nfriendliness. It was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild\\r\\nbeasts that prey. But the wolf fled at sight of him. He followed, with\\r\\nwild leapings, in a frenzy to overtake. He ran him into a blind\\r\\nchannel, in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way. The\\r\\nwolf whirled about, pivoting on his hind legs after the fashion of Joe\\r\\nand of all cornered husky dogs, snarling and bristling, clipping his\\r\\nteeth together in a continuous and rapid succession of snaps.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuck did not attack, but circled him about and hedged him in with\\r\\nfriendly advances. The wolf was suspicious and afraid; for Buck made\\r\\nthree of him in weight, while his head barely reached Buck’s shoulder.\\r\\nWatching his chance, he darted away, and the chase was resumed. Time\\r\\nand again he was cornered, and the thing repeated, though he was in\\r\\npoor condition, or Buck could not so easily have overtaken him. He\\r\\nwould run till Buck’s head was even with his flank, when he would whirl\\r\\naround at bay, only to dash away again at the first opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in the end Buck’s pertinacity was rewarded; for the wolf, finding\\r\\nthat no harm was intended, finally sniffed noses with him. Then they\\r\\nbecame friendly, and played about in the nervous, half-coy way with\\r\\nwhich fierce beasts belie their fierceness. After some time of this the\\r\\nwolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was\\r\\ngoing somewhere. He made it clear to Buck that he was to come, and they\\r\\nran side by side through the sombre twilight, straight up the creek\\r\\nbed, into the gorge from which it issued, and across the bleak divide\\r\\nwhere it took its rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the opposite slope of the watershed they came down into a level\\r\\ncountry where were great stretches of forest and many streams, and\\r\\nthrough these great stretches they ran steadily, hour after hour, the\\r\\nsun rising higher and the day growing warmer. Buck was wildly glad. He\\r\\nknew he was at last answering the call, running by the side of his wood\\r\\nbrother toward the place from where the call surely came. Old memories\\r\\nwere coming upon him fast, and he was stirring to them as of old he\\r\\nstirred to the realities of which they were the shadows. He had done\\r\\nthis thing before, somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world,\\r\\nand he was doing it again, now, running free in the open, the unpacked\\r\\nearth underfoot, the wide sky overhead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey stopped by a running stream to drink, and, stopping, Buck\\r\\nremembered John Thornton. He sat down. The wolf started on toward the\\r\\nplace from where the call surely came, then returned to him, sniffing\\r\\nnoses and making actions as though to encourage him. But Buck turned\\r\\nabout and started slowly on the back track. For the better part of an\\r\\nhour the wild brother ran by his side, whining softly. Then he sat\\r\\ndown, pointed his nose upward, and howled. It was a mournful howl, and\\r\\nas Buck held steadily on his way he heard it grow faint and fainter\\r\\nuntil it was lost in the distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Thornton was eating dinner when Buck dashed into camp and sprang\\r\\nupon him in a frenzy of affection, overturning him, scrambling upon\\r\\nhim, licking his face, biting his hand—“playing the general tom-fool,”\\r\\nas John Thornton characterized it, the while he shook Buck back and\\r\\nforth and cursed him lovingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two days and nights Buck never left camp, never let Thornton out of\\r\\nhis sight. He followed him about at his work, watched him while he ate,\\r\\nsaw him into his blankets at night and out of them in the morning. But\\r\\nafter two days the call in the forest began to sound more imperiously\\r\\nthan ever. Buck’s restlessness came back on him, and he was haunted by\\r\\nrecollections of the wild brother, and of the smiling land beyond the\\r\\ndivide and the run side by side through the wide forest stretches. Once\\r\\nagain he took to wandering in the woods, but the wild brother came no\\r\\nmore; and though he listened through long vigils, the mournful howl was\\r\\nnever raised.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began to sleep out at night, staying away from camp for days at a\\r\\ntime; and once he crossed the divide at the head of the creek and went\\r\\ndown into the land of timber and streams. There he wandered for a week,\\r\\nseeking vainly for fresh sign of the wild brother, killing his meat as\\r\\nhe travelled and travelling with the long, easy lope that seems never\\r\\nto tire. He fished for salmon in a broad stream that emptied somewhere\\r\\ninto the sea, and by this stream he killed a large black bear, blinded\\r\\nby the mosquitoes while likewise fishing, and raging through the forest\\r\\nhelpless and terrible. Even so, it was a hard fight, and it aroused the\\r\\nlast latent remnants of Buck’s ferocity. And two days later, when he\\r\\nreturned to his kill and found a dozen wolverenes quarrelling over the\\r\\nspoil, he scattered them like chaff; and those that fled left two\\r\\nbehind who would quarrel no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blood-longing became stronger than ever before. He was a killer, a\\r\\nthing that preyed, living on the things that lived, unaided, alone, by\\r\\nvirtue of his own strength and prowess, surviving triumphantly in a\\r\\nhostile environment where only the strong survived. Because of all this\\r\\nhe became possessed of a great pride in himself, which communicated\\r\\nitself like a contagion to his physical being. It advertised itself in\\r\\nall his movements, was apparent in the play of every muscle, spoke\\r\\nplainly as speech in the way he carried himself, and made his glorious\\r\\nfurry coat if anything more glorious. But for the stray brown on his\\r\\nmuzzle and above his eyes, and for the splash of white hair that ran\\r\\nmidmost down his chest, he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic\\r\\nwolf, larger than the largest of the breed. From his St. Bernard father\\r\\nhe had inherited size and weight, but it was his shepherd mother who\\r\\nhad given shape to that size and weight. His muzzle was the long wolf\\r\\nmuzzle, save that it was larger than the muzzle of any wolf; and his\\r\\nhead, somewhat broader, was the wolf head on a massive scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis cunning was wolf cunning, and wild cunning; his intelligence,\\r\\nshepherd intelligence and St. Bernard intelligence; and all this, plus\\r\\nan experience gained in the fiercest of schools, made him as formidable\\r\\na creature as any that roamed the wild. A carnivorous animal living on\\r\\na straight meat diet, he was in full flower, at the high tide of his\\r\\nlife, overspilling with vigor and virility. When Thornton passed a\\r\\ncaressing hand along his back, a snapping and crackling followed the\\r\\nhand, each hair discharging its pent magnetism at the contact. Every\\r\\npart, brain and body, nerve tissue and fibre, was keyed to the most\\r\\nexquisite pitch; and between all the parts there was a perfect\\r\\nequilibrium or adjustment. To sights and sounds and events which\\r\\nrequired action, he responded with lightning-like rapidity. Quickly as\\r\\na husky dog could leap to defend from attack or to attack, he could\\r\\nleap twice as quickly. He saw the movement, or heard sound, and\\r\\nresponded in less time than another dog required to compass the mere\\r\\nseeing or hearing. He perceived and determined and responded in the\\r\\nsame instant. In point of fact the three actions of perceiving,\\r\\ndetermining, and responding were sequential; but so infinitesimal were\\r\\nthe intervals of time between them that they appeared simultaneous. His\\r\\nmuscles were surcharged with vitality, and snapped into play sharply,\\r\\nlike steel springs. Life streamed through him in splendid flood, glad\\r\\nand rampant, until it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer\\r\\necstasy and pour forth generously over the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never was there such a dog,” said John Thornton one day, as the\\r\\npartners watched Buck marching out of camp.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When he was made, the mould was broke,” said Pete.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Py jingo! I t’ink so mineself,” Hans affirmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey saw him marching out of camp, but they did not see the instant and\\r\\nterrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the\\r\\nsecrecy of the forest. He no longer marched. At once he became a thing\\r\\nof the wild, stealing along softly, cat-footed, a passing shadow that\\r\\nappeared and disappeared among the shadows. He knew how to take\\r\\nadvantage of every cover, to crawl on his belly like a snake, and like\\r\\na snake to leap and strike. He could take a ptarmigan from its nest,\\r\\nkill a rabbit as it slept, and snap in mid air the little chipmunks\\r\\nfleeing a second too late for the trees. Fish, in open pools, were not\\r\\ntoo quick for him; nor were beaver, mending their dams, too wary. He\\r\\nkilled to eat, not from wantonness; but he preferred to eat what he\\r\\nkilled himself. So a lurking humor ran through his deeds, and it was\\r\\nhis delight to steal upon the squirrels, and, when he all but had them,\\r\\nto let them go, chattering in mortal fear to the treetops.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the fall of the year came on, the moose appeared in greater\\r\\nabundance, moving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less\\r\\nrigorous valleys. Buck had already dragged down a stray part-grown\\r\\ncalf; but he wished strongly for larger and more formidable quarry, and\\r\\nhe came upon it one day on the divide at the head of the creek. A band\\r\\nof twenty moose had crossed over from the land of streams and timber,\\r\\nand chief among them was a great bull. He was in a savage temper, and,\\r\\nstanding over six feet from the ground, was as formidable an antagonist\\r\\nas even Buck could desire. Back and forth the bull tossed his great\\r\\npalmated antlers, branching to fourteen points and embracing seven feet\\r\\nwithin the tips. His small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light,\\r\\nwhile he roared with fury at sight of Buck.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the bull’s side, just forward of the flank, protruded a feathered\\r\\narrow-end, which accounted for his savageness. Guided by that instinct\\r\\nwhich came from the old hunting days of the primordial world, Buck\\r\\nproceeded to cut the bull out from the herd. It was no slight task. He\\r\\nwould bark and dance about in front of the bull, just out of reach of\\r\\nthe great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have\\r\\nstamped his life out with a single blow. Unable to turn his back on the\\r\\nfanged danger and go on, the bull would be driven into paroxysms of\\r\\nrage. At such moments he charged Buck, who retreated craftily, luring\\r\\nhim on by a simulated inability to escape. But when he was thus\\r\\nseparated from his fellows, two or three of the younger bulls would\\r\\ncharge back upon Buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a patience of the wild—dogged, tireless, persistent as life\\r\\nitself—that holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web,\\r\\nthe snake in its coils, the panther in its ambuscade; this patience\\r\\nbelongs peculiarly to life when it hunts its living food; and it\\r\\nbelonged to Buck as he clung to the flank of the herd, retarding its\\r\\nmarch, irritating the young bulls, worrying the cows with their\\r\\nhalf-grown calves, and driving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage.\\r\\nFor half a day this continued. Buck multiplied himself, attacking from\\r\\nall sides, enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace, cutting out\\r\\nhis victim as fast as it could rejoin its mates, wearing out the\\r\\npatience of creatures preyed upon, which is a lesser patience than that\\r\\nof creatures preying.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the day wore along and the sun dropped to its bed in the northwest\\r\\n(the darkness had come back and the fall nights were six hours long),\\r\\nthe young bulls retraced their steps more and more reluctantly to the\\r\\naid of their beset leader. The down-coming winter was harrying them on\\r\\nto the lower levels, and it seemed they could never shake off this\\r\\ntireless creature that held them back. Besides, it was not the life of\\r\\nthe herd, or of the young bulls, that was threatened. The life of only\\r\\none member was demanded, which was a remoter interest than their lives,\\r\\nand in the end they were content to pay the toll.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs twilight fell the old bull stood with lowered head, watching his\\r\\nmates—the cows he had known, the calves he had fathered, the bulls he\\r\\nhad mastered—as they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading\\r\\nlight. He could not follow, for before his nose leaped the merciless\\r\\nfanged terror that would not let him go. Three hundredweight more than\\r\\nhalf a ton he weighed; he had lived a long, strong life, full of fight\\r\\nand struggle, and at the end he faced death at the teeth of a creature\\r\\nwhose head did not reach beyond his great knuckled knees.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom then on, night and day, Buck never left his prey, never gave it a\\r\\nmoment’s rest, never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or the\\r\\nshoots of young birch and willow. Nor did he give the wounded bull\\r\\nopportunity to slake his burning thirst in the slender trickling\\r\\nstreams they crossed. Often, in desperation, he burst into long\\r\\nstretches of flight. At such times Buck did not attempt to stay him,\\r\\nbut loped easily at his heels, satisfied with the way the game was\\r\\nplayed, lying down when the moose stood still, attacking him fiercely\\r\\nwhen he strove to eat or drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns, and the\\r\\nshambling trot grew weak and weaker. He took to standing for long\\r\\nperiods, with nose to the ground and dejected ears dropped limply; and\\r\\nBuck found more time in which to get water for himself and in which to\\r\\nrest. At such moments, panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes\\r\\nfixed upon the big bull, it appeared to Buck that a change was coming\\r\\nover the face of things. He could feel a new stir in the land. As the\\r\\nmoose were coming into the land, other kinds of life were coming in.\\r\\nForest and stream and air seemed palpitant with their presence. The\\r\\nnews of it was borne in upon him, not by sight, or sound, or smell, but\\r\\nby some other and subtler sense. He heard nothing, saw nothing, yet\\r\\nknew that the land was somehow different; that through it strange\\r\\nthings were afoot and ranging; and he resolved to investigate after he\\r\\nhad finished the business in hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, at the end of the fourth day, he pulled the great moose down.\\r\\nFor a day and a night he remained by the kill, eating and sleeping,\\r\\nturn and turn about. Then, rested, refreshed and strong, he turned his\\r\\nface toward camp and John Thornton. He broke into the long easy lope,\\r\\nand went on, hour after hour, never at loss for the tangled way,\\r\\nheading straight home through strange country with a certitude of\\r\\ndirection that put man and his magnetic needle to shame.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he held on he became more and more conscious of the new stir in the\\r\\nland. There was life abroad in it different from the life which had\\r\\nbeen there throughout the summer. No longer was this fact borne in upon\\r\\nhim in some subtle, mysterious way. The birds talked of it, the\\r\\nsquirrels chattered about it, the very breeze whispered of it. Several\\r\\ntimes he stopped and drew in the fresh morning air in great sniffs,\\r\\nreading a message which made him leap on with greater speed. He was\\r\\noppressed with a sense of calamity happening, if it were not calamity\\r\\nalready happened; and as he crossed the last watershed and dropped down\\r\\ninto the valley toward camp, he proceeded with greater caution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair\\r\\nrippling and bristling, It led straight toward camp and John Thornton.\\r\\nBuck hurried on, swiftly and stealthily, every nerve straining and\\r\\ntense, alert to the multitudinous details which told a story—all but\\r\\nthe end. His nose gave him a varying description of the passage of the\\r\\nlife on the heels of which he was travelling. He remarked the pregnant\\r\\nsilence of the forest. The bird life had flitted. The squirrels were in\\r\\nhiding. One only he saw,—a sleek gray fellow, flattened against a gray\\r\\ndead limb so that he seemed a part of it, a woody excrescence upon the\\r\\nwood itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Buck slid along with the obscureness of a gliding shadow, his nose\\r\\nwas jerked suddenly to the side as though a positive force had gripped\\r\\nand pulled it. He followed the new scent into a thicket and found Nig.\\r\\nHe was lying on his side, dead where he had dragged himself, an arrow\\r\\nprotruding, head and feathers, from either side of his body.\\r\\n\\r\\nA hundred yards farther on, Buck came upon one of the sled-dogs\\r\\nThornton had bought in Dawson. This dog was thrashing about in a\\r\\ndeath-struggle, directly on the trail, and Buck passed around him\\r\\nwithout stopping. From the camp came the faint sound of many voices,\\r\\nrising and falling in a sing-song chant. Bellying forward to the edge\\r\\nof the clearing, he found Hans, lying on his face, feathered with\\r\\narrows like a porcupine. At the same instant Buck peered out where the\\r\\nspruce-bough lodge had been and saw what made his hair leap straight up\\r\\non his neck and shoulders. A gust of overpowering rage swept over him.\\r\\nHe did not know that he growled, but he growled aloud with a terrible\\r\\nferocity. For the last time in his life he allowed passion to usurp\\r\\ncunning and reason, and it was because of his great love for John\\r\\nThornton that he lost his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the spruce-bough lodge\\r\\nwhen they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal\\r\\nthe like of which they had never seen before. It was Buck, a live\\r\\nhurricane of fury, hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy. He\\r\\nsprang at the foremost man (it was the chief of the Yeehats), ripping\\r\\nthe throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood.\\r\\nHe did not pause to worry the victim, but ripped in passing, with the\\r\\nnext bound tearing wide the throat of a second man. There was no\\r\\nwithstanding him. He plunged about in their very midst, tearing,\\r\\nrending, destroying, in constant and terrific motion which defied the\\r\\narrows they discharged at him. In fact, so inconceivably rapid were his\\r\\nmovements, and so closely were the Indians tangled together, that they\\r\\nshot one another with the arrows; and one young hunter, hurling a spear\\r\\nat Buck in mid air, drove it through the chest of another hunter with\\r\\nsuch force that the point broke through the skin of the back and stood\\r\\nout beyond. Then a panic seized the Yeehats, and they fled in terror to\\r\\nthe woods, proclaiming as they fled the advent of the Evil Spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd truly Buck was the Fiend incarnate, raging at their heels and\\r\\ndragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees. It was a\\r\\nfateful day for the Yeehats. They scattered far and wide over the\\r\\ncountry, and it was not till a week later that the last of the\\r\\nsurvivors gathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses.\\r\\nAs for Buck, wearying of the pursuit, he returned to the desolated\\r\\ncamp. He found Pete where he had been killed in his blankets in the\\r\\nfirst moment of surprise. Thornton’s desperate struggle was\\r\\nfresh-written on the earth, and Buck scented every detail of it down to\\r\\nthe edge of a deep pool. By the edge, head and fore feet in the water,\\r\\nlay Skeet, faithful to the last. The pool itself, muddy and discolored\\r\\nfrom the sluice boxes, effectually hid what it contained, and it\\r\\ncontained John Thornton; for Buck followed his trace into the water,\\r\\nfrom which no trace led away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll day Buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp.\\r\\nDeath, as a cessation of movement, as a passing out and away from the\\r\\nlives of the living, he knew, and he knew John Thornton was dead. It\\r\\nleft a great void in him, somewhat akin to hunger, but a void which\\r\\nached and ached, and which food could not fill, At times, when he\\r\\npaused to contemplate the carcasses of the Yeehats, he forgot the pain\\r\\nof it; and at such times he was aware of a great pride in himself,—a\\r\\npride greater than any he had yet experienced. He had killed man, the\\r\\nnoblest game of all, and he had killed in the face of the law of club\\r\\nand fang. He sniffed the bodies curiously. They had died so easily. It\\r\\nwas harder to kill a husky dog than them. They were no match at all,\\r\\nwere it not for their arrows and spears and clubs. Thenceforward he\\r\\nwould be unafraid of them except when they bore in their hands their\\r\\narrows, spears, and clubs.\\r\\n\\r\\nNight came on, and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky,\\r\\nlighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day. And with the\\r\\ncoming of the night, brooding and mourning by the pool, Buck became\\r\\nalive to a stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which\\r\\nthe Yeehats had made, He stood up, listening and scenting. From far\\r\\naway drifted a faint, sharp yelp, followed by a chorus of similar sharp\\r\\nyelps. As the moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder. Again\\r\\nBuck knew them as things heard in that other world which persisted in\\r\\nhis memory. He walked to the centre of the open space and listened. It\\r\\nwas the call, the many-noted call, sounding more luringly and\\r\\ncompellingly than ever before. And as never before, he was ready to\\r\\nobey. John Thornton was dead. The last tie was broken. Man and the\\r\\nclaims of man no longer bound him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHunting their living meat, as the Yeehats were hunting it, on the\\r\\nflanks of the migrating moose, the wolf pack had at last crossed over\\r\\nfrom the land of streams and timber and invaded Buck’s valley. Into the\\r\\nclearing where the moonlight streamed, they poured in a silvery flood;\\r\\nand in the centre of the clearing stood Buck, motionless as a statue,\\r\\nwaiting their coming. They were awed, so still and large he stood, and\\r\\na moment’s pause fell, till the boldest one leaped straight for him.\\r\\nLike a flash Buck struck, breaking the neck. Then he stood, without\\r\\nmovement, as before, the stricken wolf rolling in agony behind him.\\r\\nThree others tried it in sharp succession; and one after the other they\\r\\ndrew back, streaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward, pell-mell, crowded\\r\\ntogether, blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the prey.\\r\\nBuck’s marvellous quickness and agility stood him in good stead.\\r\\nPivoting on his hind legs, and snapping and gashing, he was everywhere\\r\\nat once, presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly\\r\\ndid he whirl and guard from side to side. But to prevent them from\\r\\ngetting behind him, he was forced back, down past the pool and into the\\r\\ncreek bed, till he brought up against a high gravel bank. He worked\\r\\nalong to a right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course\\r\\nof mining, and in this angle he came to bay, protected on three sides\\r\\nand with nothing to do but face the front.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so well did he face it, that at the end of half an hour the wolves\\r\\ndrew back discomfited. The tongues of all were out and lolling, the\\r\\nwhite fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight. Some were lying\\r\\ndown with heads raised and ears pricked forward; others stood on their\\r\\nfeet, watching him; and still others were lapping water from the pool.\\r\\nOne wolf, long and lean and gray, advanced cautiously, in a friendly\\r\\nmanner, and Buck recognized the wild brother with whom he had run for a\\r\\nnight and a day. He was whining softly, and, as Buck whined, they\\r\\ntouched noses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen an old wolf, gaunt and battle-scarred, came forward. Buck writhed\\r\\nhis lips into the preliminary of a snarl, but sniffed noses with him,\\r\\nWhereupon the old wolf sat down, pointed nose at the moon, and broke\\r\\nout the long wolf howl. The others sat down and howled. And now the\\r\\ncall came to Buck in unmistakable accents. He, too, sat down and\\r\\nhowled. This over, he came out of his angle and the pack crowded around\\r\\nhim, sniffing in half-friendly, half-savage manner. The leaders lifted\\r\\nthe yelp of the pack and sprang away into the woods. The wolves swung\\r\\nin behind, yelping in chorus. And Buck ran with them, side by side with\\r\\nthe wild brother, yelping as he ran.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd here may well end the story of Buck. The years were not many when\\r\\nthe Yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves; for some were\\r\\nseen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle, and with a rift of\\r\\nwhite centring down the chest. But more remarkable than this, the\\r\\nYeehats tell of a Ghost Dog that runs at the head of the pack. They are\\r\\nafraid of this Ghost Dog, for it has cunning greater than they,\\r\\nstealing from their camps in fierce winters, robbing their traps,\\r\\nslaying their dogs, and defying their bravest hunters.\\r\\n\\r\\nNay, the tale grows worse. Hunters there are who fail to return to the\\r\\ncamp, and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with\\r\\nthroats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the\\r\\nsnow greater than the prints of any wolf. Each fall, when the Yeehats\\r\\nfollow the movement of the moose, there is a certain valley which they\\r\\nnever enter. And women there are who become sad when the word goes over\\r\\nthe fire of how the Evil Spirit came to select that valley for an\\r\\nabiding-place.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the summers there is one visitor, however, to that valley, of which\\r\\nthe Yeehats do not know. It is a great, gloriously coated wolf, like,\\r\\nand yet unlike, all other wolves. He crosses alone from the smiling\\r\\ntimber land and comes down into an open space among the trees. Here a\\r\\nyellow stream flows from rotted moose-hide sacks and sinks into the\\r\\nground, with long grasses growing through it and vegetable mould\\r\\noverrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun; and here he muses\\r\\nfor a time, howling once, long and mournfully, ere he departs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he is not always alone. When the long winter nights come on and the\\r\\nwolves follow their meat into the lower valleys, he may be seen running\\r\\nat the head of the pack through the pale moonlight or glimmering\\r\\nborealis, leaping gigantic above his fellows, his great throat a-bellow\\r\\nas he sings a song of the younger world, which is the song of the pack.'"
